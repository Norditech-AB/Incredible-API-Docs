## What Incredible Does

Incredible Agents connect your apps and run tasks automatically. You describe what you want done in plain language, connect your apps once, and the agent handles it from there—daily, weekly, or whenever something triggers it.

**How agents differ from other tools:**

| Approach | How it works | Limitation |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Chatbots | You ask, it responds | Requires you to be present |
| Workflow builders | Fixed steps, runs automatically | Breaks when data changes |
| **Incredible Agents** | Understands task, adapts, runs automatically | — |

Agents think through your task, take actions in your apps, and deliver results. If something unexpected happens, they adapt instead of failing.

## What You Can Automate

| Category | Example task | Apps involved |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Daily summaries | Email me the top 5 tech news stories every morning | Web Search → Email |
| Meeting prep | Research attendees before my meetings start | Calendar → Web Search → Email |
| Data sync | When a form is submitted, add to spreadsheet and notify team | Forms → Sheets → Slack |
| Monitoring | Alert me when competitors publish news | Web Search → Email |
| Reports | Every Friday, summarize this week's sales data | CRM → Email |
| Lead research | When a new lead appears, research their company | Sheets → Web Search → Sheets |

Incredible connects to hundreds of apps including Gmail, Slack, Google Sheets, Notion, Salesforce, HubSpot, GitHub, and more. See [Integrations](/agents/integrations) for the full list.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe your task">
    Write what you want in plain language. Example: "Every morning at 8am, search for AI news from the last 24 hours and email me the top 5 stories."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your apps">
    Sign in to the apps your agent needs. This happens once per app—Incredible remembers your connection for all your agents.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set when it runs">
    Choose a schedule (daily at 9am, every Monday) or an event trigger (when an email arrives, when a row is added). See [Triggers](/agents/triggers) for details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate">
    Enable your schedule or publish your event trigger. Your agent runs automatically and delivers results to your chosen destination.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Your Apps

Once you connect an app, that connection is available for all your agents.

**Where to manage connections:** Click the **Accounts** button in the topbar (shows your connected app icons) to:
- View all connected accounts
- Reconnect if something expires
- See which apps your agent uses

<Tip>
You don't need to reconnect apps for each agent. Connect Gmail once, and every agent can use it.
