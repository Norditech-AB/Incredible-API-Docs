## What This Covers

This page explains Agent MAX—the engine that powers Incredible Agents—and why it helps your automations succeed where others fail.

## What Agent MAX Is

Agent MAX is the system that runs your agents. It's designed for "Deep Work"—complex, multi-step tasks that need to complete fully without your supervision.

Most AI tools struggle with long tasks. They lose track of the goal, make up information, or fail silently. Agent MAX solves these problems so your agents finish what they start.

## Capabilities

| Capability | What it means | Why it matters to you |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Accurate outputs** | Uses only real data from your apps. Validates every action before executing. | Results are correct. No fabricated information. |
| **Completes tasks** | Checks that all steps finished successfully before marking done. | No partial results. No silent failures. |
| **Stays focused** | Maintains goal alignment across long tasks, even 20+ steps. | Doesn't get distracted or lose track halfway through. |
| **Fixes errors** | Detects problems and retries automatically with adjustments. | Recovers from issues without your help. |
| **Stops when stuck** | Recognizes when it can't make progress and terminates cleanly. | No infinite loops. No runaway costs. |
| **Cost efficient** | Uses the right amount of processing for each step—fast for simple actions, powerful for complex reasoning. | Lower costs without sacrificing quality. |
| **Deep memory** | Handles large amounts of context efficiently—up to 10x more than typical AI. | Can work with big datasets and long tasks. |

## When This Matters

Agent MAX capabilities become important when you're running:

## How It Helps

**Without Agent MAX:**
- Agent completes 3 of 5 steps, stops without warning
- Output contains invented information not from your data
- Same error keeps repeating, wasting resources
- Long tasks drift off-topic and deliver wrong results

**With Agent MAX:**
- All 5 steps complete with verification
- Every piece of data traced to your connected apps
- Errors caught and recovered automatically
- Goal maintained from start to finish

## Comparing Approaches

| Problem | Typical AI | Agent MAX |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Task requires 15 steps | May lose focus by step 8 | Maintains goal throughout |
| API returns unexpected error | Fails or loops | Adapts and retries with adjustments |
| Large dataset to process | Forgets early data | Compresses context, retains what matters |
| Vague instruction | Invents details | Uses only available data, asks for clarification |
