## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does it take to set up my first agent?">
    About 5-10 minutes. You describe what you want in plain English, connect your apps (one-time sign-in), and test it. Most people have their first agent running within their first session.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need technical skills or coding knowledge?">
    No. You write instructions in plain English, like "When I get a new email from a client, add their details to my spreadsheet." No coding, no complex setup, no technical configuration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's a good first automation to try?">
    Start with something simple you do regularly:
    - **Daily news digest** — Get news on a topic emailed to you each morning
    - **Meeting prep** — Research attendees before calendar events
    - **Data entry** — Copy info from emails to a spreadsheet
    
    See our [How-to Guides](/agents/guides/index) for step-by-step examples.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does it work with the apps I already use?">
    Probably! We connect to hundreds of apps including Gmail, Slack, Google Sheets, Notion, HubSpot, Salesforce, GitHub, Trello, and more. See [Integrations](/agents/integrations) for the full list.
  </Accordion>

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is this different from Zapier or Make?">
    Traditional automation tools (Zapier, Make) require you to build fixed workflows: "When X happens, do Y, then Z." You define every step.
    
    Incredible Agents are different—you describe the **outcome** you want, and the agent figures out how to achieve it. If data varies or something unexpected happens, the agent adapts instead of failing.
    
    | Approach | How it works |
    |----------|-------------|
    | **Zapier/Make** | You build fixed steps. Breaks if data changes. |
    | **Incredible Agents** | You describe the goal. Agent adapts to variations. |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does it actually work autonomously? Like, overnight?">
    Yes. Once you set up a schedule or trigger, your agent runs completely on its own—even while you sleep. You'll see results in your run history and get outputs delivered to your specified destination (email, Slack, spreadsheet, etc.).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see what the agent is doing?">
    Absolutely. You have full visibility:
    - **Live view** — Watch each step execute in real-time when you test
    - **Run history** — Review every past run, see exactly what happened
    - **Step details** — Click any action to see the data used and results
    
    Nothing happens in a black box.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What triggers can start an agent?">
    Two options:
    - **Schedule** — Run at specific times (daily at 9am, every Monday, etc.)
    - **Events** — Run when something happens (new email, new spreadsheet row, new Slack message, etc.)
    
    See [Triggers](/agents/triggers) for details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reliability & Trust

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will the AI make mistakes?">
    Agents are highly reliable, but not perfect. That's why we built safeguards:
    - **Validation** — Agents check their work before executing actions
    - **No hallucination** — Agents only use real data from your apps, never make things up
    - **Testing** — Always test before going live with the Play button
    
    For critical tasks, we recommend reviewing the first few runs before fully trusting autonomous operation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if the agent does something wrong?">
    You have full control:
    - **Stop anytime** — Disable the schedule or unpublish the trigger instantly
    - **Review history** — See exactly what happened and when
    - **Version rollback** — Restore previous agent configurations
    
    Agents also have built-in safeguards: they stop cleanly if stuck, never loop indefinitely, and preserve partial results when possible.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is my data safe?">
    Yes. We take security seriously:
    - **Minimal access** — We only access what you specifically authorize
    - **No storage** — We don't store your app data; it flows through in real-time
    - **Secure connections** — All app connections use OAuth (industry standard)
    - **Your control** — Disconnect any app anytime from your account settings
    
    See our [privacy policy](https://incredible.one/privacy) for full details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my connected app has an outage?">
    Agents handle errors gracefully:
    - **Auto-retry** — Temporary failures are retried automatically
    - **Clear errors** — If something fails permanently, you see exactly what happened
    - **No cascading failures** — One failed step doesn't corrupt other data
    
    You're notified of any issues so you can address them.
  </Accordion>

## Cost & Limits

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much does it cost?">
    You can start free and try it out. Pricing is based on how much you use—number of agent runs and complexity. Most individuals and small teams find great value in the basic plan.
    
    Check [incredible.one](https://incredible.one) for current pricing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I reduce costs?">
    A few ways:
    - **Disable unused features** — Only enable the app features your agent needs
    - **Write clear instructions** — Specific prompts mean fewer retries
    - **Right-size your schedule** — Daily might be enough instead of hourly
    
    See [Managing Costs](/agents/cost-optimization) for detailed tips.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a limit to how many agents I can have?">
    Depends on your plan. Free accounts have limits; paid plans scale up. Check [incredible.one](https://incredible.one) for current limits.
