## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have an agent that searches for news and emails you a daily summary. The same process works for any task—data syncing, monitoring, reports, or anything else you want to automate.

**Example result:** Every morning at 8am, you receive an email with the top 5 AI news stories from the past 24 hours.

## Before You Start

- An Incredible account ([sign up free](https://incredible.one))
- About 10 minutes

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your agent">
    From the homepage, type what you want to automate in the input field:
    
    ```
    Every morning, search for AI news from the last 24 hours and email me a summary of the top 5 stories.
    ```
    
    Click **Create**. This opens your agent workspace.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the workspace">
    Your workspace has two sides:
    
    - **Left panel:** Chat with Incredible. This is where you refine your task and make changes.
    - **Right panel:** Your agent's current configuration—the task description, connected apps, and controls.
    
    Incredible has already interpreted your request and set up the initial configuration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Refine with Incredible">
    Incredible may ask clarifying questions:
    
    - "What email address should I send to?"
    - "Any specific sources you want me to check?"
    
    Answer in the chat. Incredible updates your agent automatically.
    
    You can also ask for changes:
    - "Add a summary of competitor news too"
    - "Send to Slack instead of email"
    - "Run at 7am instead"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Connect your apps">
    If your agent needs apps you haven't connected yet, Incredible will prompt you.
    
    Click the app name to connect. You'll sign in once—Incredible remembers your connection for future agents.
    
    <Info>
    **For this example:** The built-in Web Search and Email features don't require app connections. You can test immediately.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test your agent">
    Click the **Play** button (▶️ in the topbar, right side) to run your agent now.
    
    Watch it work:
    - You'll see each step as it executes
    - Search results appear as the agent finds them
    - The final email is composed and sent
    
    Check your inbox to verify the result.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up a schedule">
    Click **Add Trigger** (⚡ in the topbar) and select **Schedule**.
    
    Configure when your agent runs:
    - **Frequency:** Daily, Weekly, or Monthly
    - **Time:** 8:00 AM (or your preferred time)
    - **Timezone:** Auto-detected, or select manually
    - **Days:** For weekly schedules, select which days to run
    
    The schedule saves automatically as you configure it.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable your schedule">
    Click **Enable** to activate your schedule. Your agent will now run automatically at the configured time.
    
    You'll see a blue schedule indicator in the topbar showing when the next run occurs.
    
    <Tip>
    To stop automatic runs, return to the schedule settings and click **Disable** or **Remove schedule**.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>
