## What This Covers

This page explains how agent costs work and how to reduce them without affecting results.

## How Costs Work

Each time your agent runs, it uses processing resources. The main factor affecting cost is how many **features** are enabled.

```
More enabled features → More processing required → Higher cost per run
```

Each connected app has multiple features (actions it can perform). An app like Gmail might have 15+ features: read emails, send emails, add labels, search, delete, and more. Your agent only needs the features relevant to its task.

## Reducing Costs

### 1. Disable Unused Features

This is the most effective way to reduce costs.

**Where to find it:** Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) next to your connected apps, or click on any app pill to open the feature manager.

**What you'll see:** Each connected app shows a list of features with toggles. A counter shows how many are enabled (e.g., "5/15 enabled").

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open feature manager">
    Click the **⚙️ gear icon** next to your apps, or click on any app pill directly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an app">
    Click on the app you want to optimize.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review features">
    Look at what's enabled. Ask: "Does my task actually need this?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable unused features">
    Toggle off anything your task doesn't use.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**

| Task | App | Features needed | Features to disable |
|------|-----|-----------------|---------------------|
| Read and summarize emails | Gmail | Read messages, Search | Send, Delete, Labels, Draft, etc. |
| Post updates to Slack | Slack | Send message | Read messages, Reactions, Channels, etc. |
| Add rows to spreadsheet | Sheets | Add row, Read sheet | Delete, Format, Create sheet, etc. |

### 2. Remove Unused Apps

If your agent doesn't use an app at all, remove it entirely.

**How:** Click the **⚙️ gear icon** next to your apps, find the app to remove, and click **Remove this app**.

<Warning>
Only remove apps your agent truly doesn't use. If you're unsure, test your agent with the Play button first.
</Warning>

### 3. Write Clear Instructions

Unclear instructions cause agents to take extra steps or retry actions.

- **Vague:** Costs more because agent tries multiple approaches
- **Specific:** Agent takes the direct path, fewer resources used

See [Writing Instructions](/agents/prompting-best-practices) for how to be specific.

## Before and After

| Configuration | Features enabled | Result |
|---------------|-----------------|--------|
| All Gmail features on | 15 features | Higher cost per run |
| Only needed features | 3 features | ~70% lower cost, same results |

The output is identical—your agent does the same task. The difference is how much processing is required to load and consider those features.

<Tip>
**Incredible helps automatically.** When you describe your task in the chat, Incredible analyzes it and selects only the features your agent needs. Manual optimization is only necessary if you want to fine-tune further or if your task changes.

## Cost Review Checklist

<Check>Open Manage Apps for your agent</Check>
<Check>Review each connected app's enabled features</Check>
<Check>Disable any features your task doesn't use</Check>
<Check>Remove any apps not needed for the task</Check>
<Check>Test that your agent still works after changes</Check>

## Why Fewer Features Helps

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Lower cost** | Less processing per run |
| **Faster execution** | Agent considers fewer options |
| **More accurate** | Agent stays focused on relevant actions |
| **Clearer debugging** | If something fails, fewer places to check |
