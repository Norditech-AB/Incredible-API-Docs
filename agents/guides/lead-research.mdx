## What This Agent Does

When a new lead appears in your spreadsheet, the agent researches their company and fills in missing information. Sales teams save hours of manual research.

**Example output:** A new row is added to your Leads sheet. Within minutes, the agent fills in company size, industry, recent news, and LinkedIn profile.

## Example Prompt

```
When a new row is added to my Leads spreadsheet at [SPREADSHEET URL]:

1. Get the company name from column B
2. Search the web for information about this company
3. Find:
   - Company size (employees)
   - Industry
   - One sentence about recent news or what they do

4. Update the same row:
   - Company size in column D
   - Industry in column E
   - Recent news in column F

If any information can't be found, leave that cell empty.
```

## Variations

| Use Case | Modification |
|----------|-------------|
| **Find LinkedIn profiles** | "Also find the company's LinkedIn URL and add to column G" |
| **Notify sales team** | "After updating, send a Slack message to #new-leads with the company summary" |
| **Score the lead** | "Rate the lead 1-5 based on company size and add to column H" |
| **Research contacts** | "Find the CEO's name and LinkedIn profile" |

## Tips

<Tip>
**Always specify column letters.** The agent can't guess which column is which—be explicit about where data goes.
</Tip>

- Include the full spreadsheet URL in your prompt
- Tell the agent what to do if information isn't found
- Test with a few leads before going live
