## What This Agent Does

Monitors news about your competitors and alerts you when something significant happens—funding rounds, product launches, leadership changes, or partnerships.

**Example output:** Every Friday, you receive a summary of what your top 3 competitors did this week. If something major happens (like a funding round), you get an immediate alert.

## Setup

    Create a summary of significant news: funding, product launches, 
    partnerships, and leadership changes.
    
    Email the summary to [your-email@example.com] with subject 
    "Weekly Competitor Update - [DATE]".
    ```
  </Step>

## Example Prompt

```
Every Friday at 9am, research my competitors from the past 7 days.

Competitors to track:
- [Competitor 1]
- [Competitor 2]  
- [Competitor 3]

For each competitor, find news about:
- Funding rounds or acquisitions
- New product launches or features
- Partnerships or integrations
- Leadership changes
- Major customer wins

Create a summary organized by competitor. Include:
- Headline and source for each story
- 2-sentence summary
- Why it matters (my assessment)

Email to [YOUR EMAIL] with subject "Weekly Competitor Update - [DATE]".

If no significant news was found for a competitor, note "No major updates this week."
```

## Variations

| Use Case | Modification |
|----------|-------------|
| **Daily monitoring** | Change schedule to daily for fast-moving markets |
| **Slack alerts** | "Post to #competitive-intel on Slack" |
| **Add to spreadsheet** | "Also add each news item as a row to my Competitor Tracker spreadsheet" |
| **Include social media** | "Check their Twitter/X accounts for announcements too" |

## Tips

<Tip>
**Be specific about what matters.** "Funding rounds over $10M" or "Enterprise customer announcements" helps filter noise.
</Tip>

- Name competitors explicitly—don't use generic terms
- Define what counts as "significant" for your industry
- Consider a daily schedule for fast-moving competitive landscapes
