## What This Agent Does

Before your meetings, the agent researches attendees and sends you a brief. Know who you're meeting with without manual research.

**Example output:** 30 minutes before your 2pm call with Acme Corp, you receive an email with background on the attendees—their roles, recent company news, and talking points.

</Steps>

## Example Prompt

```
30 minutes before each meeting on my Google Calendar:

1. Get the meeting title and attendee list
2. For each external attendee (not from my company @mycompany.com):
   - Find their name, role, and company
   - Search for recent news about their company
   - Find their LinkedIn profile if available

3. Create a brief that includes:
   - Meeting title and time
   - Attendee summaries
   - 3 suggested talking points based on their company's recent news

4. Email the brief to [YOUR EMAIL] with subject "Meeting Prep: [MEETING TITLE]"

Skip meetings with only internal attendees.
```

## Variations

| Use Case | Modification |
|----------|-------------|
| **Slack instead of email** | "Send the brief to #meeting-prep on Slack" |
| **Only external meetings** | "Skip meetings where all attendees are from @mycompany.com" |
| **Include past interactions** | "Check my email history for past conversations with these people" |
| **Different lead time** | "15 minutes before" or "1 hour before" |

## Tips

<Tip>
**Filter out internal meetings.** Add "Skip meetings with only internal attendees from @mycompany.com" to avoid unnecessary briefs.
</Tip>

- Specify your company's email domain to identify internal vs external attendees
- Include your email address for delivery
- Test with a real external meeting to verify the research quality
