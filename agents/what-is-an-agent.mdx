## What This Covers

This page explains what an Incredible Agent is, how it processes tasks, and what kinds of work it handles well.

## What an Agent Is

An Incredible Agent is an AI that connects to your apps, follows your instructions, and completes tasks without you watching. You set it up once, and it runs automatically—on a schedule or when something triggers it.

**How an agent works:**

```
Trigger (schedule or event)
    ↓
Agent receives task + context
    ↓
Plans the steps needed
    ↓
Takes actions in your apps
    ↓
Delivers results to your destination
```

## How Agents Think

When your agent runs, it:

1. **Receives the task** — Your instructions plus any context (like "new email arrived" if triggered by email)
2. **Plans the approach** — Determines what steps to take and in what order
3. **Executes actions** — Reads data, processes it, writes to destinations
4. **Validates results** — Checks that actions completed successfully
5. **Retries if needed** — Adapts when something fails instead of stopping

This is different from simple automation that follows fixed steps. Agents understand your goal and figure out how to achieve it, even when data varies.

## What Agents Need From You

For reliable results, agents need:

| Requirement | Example | Why it matters |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Clear instructions | "Search for AI news from the last 24 hours" | Vague tasks produce inconsistent results |
| Connected apps | Gmail, Slack, Sheets | Agent can only use apps you've connected |
| Specific details | Email addresses, channel names, spreadsheet links | Agent can't guess what you mean |

See [Writing Instructions](/agents/prompting-best-practices) for how to write effective task descriptions.

## What Agents Cannot Do

- **Use apps not available in Incredible** — The agent works only with connected integrations
- **Guess missing information** — If you don't specify an email address or channel, the agent can't infer it
- **Make judgment calls you haven't defined** — "Important" emails need criteria like sender, subject keywords, or labels
- **Access data you haven't connected** — Private documents, databases, or systems require integration

## Version History

Every time your agent is updated, a version is saved automatically. You can review previous versions and restore them if needed.

### Where to Find It

Click the **version badge** (shows v1, v2, etc.) in the topbar to open version history.

### What's Saved in Each Version

| Saved | Not Saved |
|-------|-----------|
| Task instructions (prompt) | Schedule settings |
| Connected apps | Trigger configuration |
| Agent description | Enabled features |
| Agent icon | Run history |

### Restoring a Previous Version

1. Click the version badge in the topbar
2. Browse the version list (newest at top)
3. Click a version to see what it contained
4. Select a version to restore your agent to that state

<Info>
Restoring a version updates your task, apps, and description—but keeps your current schedule and trigger settings.

<Accordion title="Common questions">

**How long do agents take to run?**

Simple tasks (search and email) take 30-60 seconds. Complex tasks with many steps can take several minutes.

**Can I watch an agent run?**

Yes. Click **Play** (▶️) to run your agent and watch each step execute in real time.

**What happens if an agent fails?**

You're notified of the error. Click **History** (🕐) to see what happened, adjust your configuration, and test again.

**Can I pause an agent?**

Yes. For schedules, click the schedule pill and disable. For event triggers, click the Live indicator and unpublish. Your configuration is preserved.

**How many agents can I have?**

This depends on your plan. Check [incredible.one](https://incredible.one) for current limits.

**Can I undo changes to my agent?**

Yes. Use version history (click the v1, v2, etc. badge) to restore a previous configuration.
