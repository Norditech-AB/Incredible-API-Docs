## What This Covers

This page explains how to test your agent before publishing. Testing catches problems before your agent runs automatically.

## Why Test

- **Catch errors early** — Find problems before they affect real workflows
- **Verify output format** — Make sure results look right
- **Confirm destination** — Check that data goes where you expect
- **Build confidence** — Know your agent does what you intended

## Two Testing Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Quick Test (Play Button)">
    **When to use:** Any agent. Best for scheduled agents or when you want to test immediately.
    
    **How it works:** Click Play, and your agent runs right now. You watch each step execute in real time.
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Click Play">
        Find the **Play** button (▶️) in the topbar on the right side.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Watch execution">
        See each step as it happens: data fetched, actions taken, results generated.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Check output">
        Verify the final result. Did the email arrive? Is the spreadsheet row correct? Is the Slack message formatted right?
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review run details">
        Click on any step to see exactly what data was used and what was returned.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Trigger Test (Event Triggers Only)">
    **When to use:** Agents with an event trigger configured (new email, form submission, calendar event, etc.)
    
    **How it works:** Click Test, then perform the trigger action. The agent waits for the real event, captures the data, and shows you how it responds.
    
    <Info>
    The **Test** button only appears after you've configured an event trigger. For scheduled agents, use the Play button instead.
    </Info>
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Click Test">
        Find the **Test** button (🚀) in the topbar. This appears next to the Publish button for event-triggered agents.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Wait for the modal">
        A "Listening for trigger" modal appears with a timer. Your agent is now waiting for the event.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Trigger the event">
        Do the action that triggers your agent: send a test email, add a spreadsheet row, create a calendar event.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Watch the capture">
        When the event is detected (usually within 1-2 minutes), the modal shows "Trigger received!" and your agent starts running.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Review the run">
        See how your agent processed the trigger and what output it produced.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    <Warning>
    If no event is detected within the timeout period, the test session expires. Click Test again to start a new session.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What to Verify

<Check>**Data retrieved correctly** — Does the agent get the right information?</Check>
<Check>**Processing accurate** — Are summaries, calculations, or transformations correct?</Check>
<Check>**Output format right** — Does the result look how you expected?</Check>
<Check>**Delivered to correct place** — Did it go to the right email, channel, or spreadsheet?</Check>
<Check>**Handles edge cases** — What happens if data is missing or unexpected?</Check>

## Viewing Run History

Every run is saved so you can review what happened.

**Where to find it:** Click the **History** button (🕐 clock icon) in the topbar.

### What You'll See

| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Run number (#1, #2, etc.) | Order of execution, newest first |
| Time | When the run started |
| **Triggered** badge | Run was automatic (from schedule or event) |
| Blue highlight | You haven't viewed this run yet |

### Reviewing a Run

Click any run to see:
- Each step the agent took
- Data retrieved from apps
- Actions performed
- Final output delivered
- Any errors that occurred

<Tip>
New background runs (from schedules or triggers) show a notification badge on the History button. Click to review them.
</Tip>

## Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to check |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Agent doesn't find data | Wrong time range or filter | Check your date ranges and search criteria |
| Output goes to wrong place | Incorrect destination in instructions | Verify email addresses, channel names, spreadsheet links |
| Format looks wrong | Instructions unclear about format | Be more specific about how output should look |
| Agent errors on a step | App not connected or permission issue | Click **Accounts** in topbar to reconnect |
| Trigger not detected | Trigger not published or wrong config | Ensure event trigger shows green "Live" status |
| Results are empty | No data matches criteria | Broaden your search or check that source data exists |
| Test button missing | No event trigger configured | Test button only appears for event-triggered agents |

## After Testing

Once testing confirms your agent works:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save the version">
    Your agent saves automatically whenever you make changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your trigger">
    Configure when the agent runs: schedule (daily, weekly) or event trigger (new email, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate">
    - **For schedules:** Click **Enable** in the schedule settings. The schedule activates immediately.
    - **For event triggers:** Click **Publish** in the topbar. Status changes from Draft (amber) to Live (green).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor first runs">
    Check the first few automatic runs in **History** (🕐) to confirm everything works.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Test after changes.** Whenever you modify your agent's instructions or app connections, test again before relying on automatic runs.
</Tip>

## Testing Checklist

<Check>Run a quick test with Play button</Check>
<Check>Check that output appears in the correct destination</Check>
<Check>Verify output format matches expectations</Check>
<Check>For event-triggered agents, do a trigger test with real event</Check>
<Check>Review any errors in History (🕐)</Check>
<Check>Enable schedule or publish event trigger only after successful test</Check>
