## What Gets Deleted

When your account is deleted, the following are permanently removed:

- Your user profile and settings
- All agents you created
- App connections and integration accounts
- Run history and logs
- Community submissions you made
- Upvotes you gave

## What Happens to Connected Apps

<Info>
Deleting your Incredible account disconnects your apps from Incredible. It does **not** delete anything in those apps themselves.

Your Gmail, Slack, spreadsheets, and other apps remain unchanged. Only the connection to Incredible is removed.
</Info>

## Before You Delete

<Warning>
Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

Consider these alternatives:

| If you want to... | Do this instead |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Stop agents from running | Unpublish triggers (keeps agents saved) |
| Disconnect an app | Remove it in Manage Apps (keeps account) |
| Take a break | Just stop using the platform (data preserved) |
| Remove one agent | Delete that specific agent |
