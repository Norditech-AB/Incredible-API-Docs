</Info>

## Browsing Integrations

When creating or editing an agent, you can browse available apps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the app browser">
    In your agent workspace, click the **+** button next to your connected apps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search or browse">
    - Type to search by name
    - Scroll to browse all available apps
    - Apps are organized by category
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add an app">
    Click an app to add it to your agent. If it requires connection, you'll be prompted to sign in.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Connecting Apps

Most apps require you to sign in once. After that, the connection is available for all your agents.

### Connection Methods

| Method | How it works | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **OAuth** | Click Connect → Sign in with the app | Gmail, Slack, Google Sheets |
| **API Key** | Enter your API key from the app | Some developer tools |
| **No Auth** | Works immediately, no sign-in needed | Web Search, Email Me |

### First-Time Connection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the app">
    Click **+** and select the app you want to use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect when prompted">
    If the app requires authentication, click **Connect** to sign in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Follow the app's sign-in flow and grant the required permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done">
    The connection is saved. You can now use this app in any agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Connections persist across agents.** Connect Gmail once, and all your agents can use it. No need to sign in repeatedly.
</Tip>

## Managing Connections

### Viewing Connected Accounts

Click the **Accounts** button in the topbar (shows app icons) to see:
- All apps connected for this agent
- Connection status for each app
- Options to reconnect if needed

### Reconnecting an App

If a connection expires or stops working:

1. Click **Accounts** in the topbar
2. Find the app with issues
3. Click **Reconnect**
4. Sign in again to refresh the connection

### Disconnecting an App

To remove an app from your agent:

1. Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) next to your connected apps
2. Find the app to remove
3. Click **Remove this app**

<Warning>
Removing an app from your agent doesn't delete the connection. Other agents can still use it. To fully disconnect from Incredible, contact support.
</Warning>

## Managing Features

Each app has multiple features (actions it can perform). You can control which features your agent can use.

### Why Manage Features?

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Lower cost** | Fewer features = less processing per run |
| **Faster execution** | Agent considers fewer options |
| **More accurate** | Agent stays focused on relevant actions |

### Viewing Features

1. Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) next to your connected apps, or click on any app pill
2. See all features for that app with toggles
3. A counter shows how many are enabled (e.g., "5/15 enabled")

### Enabling/Disabling Features

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Manage Apps">
    Click the **gear icon** (⚙️) next to your connected apps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an app">
    Click on the app you want to configure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle features">
    Turn features on/off based on what your agent needs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:** For an agent that only reads and summarizes emails:
- ✅ Enable: Read messages, Search messages
- ❌ Disable: Send email, Create draft, Delete, Add label, etc.

<Tip>
**Incredible auto-selects features.** When you describe your task, Incredible automatically enables only the features needed. Manual adjustment is optional for fine-tuning.
</Tip>

## Common Integration Questions

<Accordion title="What if my app isn't available?">
If you need an integration that isn't listed:
1. Check if it's available under a different name
2. Request it in our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/pNmdkxgBe2)
3. Some apps can be connected via generic integrations (webhooks, APIs)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use multiple accounts for the same app?">
Currently, each app is connected to one account per user. If you need multiple accounts (e.g., two Gmail addresses), contact support for options.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What permissions does Incredible request?">
Incredible requests only the permissions needed for the features you use. You can review permissions during the OAuth sign-in flow. We never access more than necessary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is my data safe?">
Yes. Incredible:
- Only accesses data when your agent runs
- Never stores your app credentials (OAuth handles this securely)
- Processes data in real-time without long-term storage
- See our [privacy policy](https://incredible.one/privacy) for details
</Accordion>
