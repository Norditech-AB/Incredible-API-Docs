## What This Covers

This page explains how to write effective instructions for your agents. Clear instructions lead to consistent, accurate results.

**Where to write instructions:**
- When creating an agent, type your task in the input on the homepage
- For existing agents, use the chat (left panel) to describe what you want—Incredible updates your agent automatically
- You can also directly edit the task in the right panel

## The Formula

<Info>
Every effective instruction has three parts:

1. **Where to get information** — Which app, what data, what timeframe
2. **What to do with it** — Summarize, copy, calculate, filter, etc.
3. **Where to put the result** — Email, Slack, spreadsheet, etc.
</Info>

**Example using the formula:**

```
1. Get all emails from Gmail with "invoice" in the subject from the last 7 days
2. Extract the sender, amount, and due date from each
3. Add a row for each invoice to my "Invoices" spreadsheet at [link]
```

## Being Specific

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good">
    ```
    Every morning at 8am, search for news about artificial intelligence 
    from the last 24 hours. Find the top 5 stories by relevance. 
    Email a summary to sarah@company.com with the subject 
    "AI News - [today's date]".
    ```
    
    **Why this works:**
    - Specific time and frequency
    - Clear search topic
    - Defined number of results
    - Exact email address
    - Defined subject line format
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Needs work">
    ```
    Check for interesting AI news and send me updates.
    ```
    
    **Problems:**
    - When should it run?
    - What counts as "interesting"?
    - How many stories?
    - Send to where?
    - What format?
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Details to Include

| Detail type | Example | Why it matters |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Links** | `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/abc123` | Agent can't guess which spreadsheet you mean |
| **Email addresses** | `team@company.com` | "Email me" requires knowing where |
| **Channel names** | `#sales-updates` | Slack has many channels |
| **Time ranges** | "last 24 hours", "from Dec 1-7" | Prevents unbounded searches |
| **Quantities** | "top 5", "all", "first 10" | Sets clear expectations |
| **Column names** | "the 'Status' column" | Identifies exact data location |
| **Filters** | "with label 'urgent'" | Narrows scope precisely |

## Full Example

```
Get all new rows added to the "Leads" sheet in this spreadsheet 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1abc123/edit 
from the last 24 hours (the "Created At" column has the timestamp).

For each new lead:
1. Search the web for information about their company (domain is in column C)
2. Find company size, industry, and recent news

Update each row with the research:
- Company size in column F
- Industry in column G  
- One-sentence summary of recent news in column H

After updating all rows, post a message in #sales-leads on Slack:
"Added research for [number] new leads. Check the spreadsheet."
```

**Why this works:**
- Exact spreadsheet link provided
- Time range and timestamp column specified
- Clear list of what to research
- Specific columns for each data point
- Defined notification channel and message format

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Problem | How to fix |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| "Check my calendar" | Which calendar app? | "Check my Google Calendar" |
| "Send to the team" | Who specifically? | "Send to #team-updates in Slack" |
| "Recent emails" | How recent? | "Emails from the last 48 hours" |
| "Important items" | What criteria? | "Items with 'urgent' in subject or from @vip.com" |
| "Add to my spreadsheet" | Which one? | Include the full spreadsheet URL |
| "Summarize the data" | Deliver where? | "Email the summary to me at [address]" |
| Schedule in task | Causes confusion | Set schedule separately using Add Trigger (⚡) |

<Accordion title="Advanced patterns">

**Conditional logic:**
```
For each email, if the sender domain is in my "VIP List" spreadsheet, 
forward to #urgent-inbox. Otherwise, add to the daily digest.
```

**Multiple outputs:**
```
Create a summary and:
1. Email it to sarah@company.com
2. Post in #weekly-updates on Slack
3. Add as a new row to the Reports spreadsheet
```

**Handling missing data:**
```
For each lead, find their LinkedIn profile. 
If no LinkedIn found, leave column D empty and continue to the next lead.
```
