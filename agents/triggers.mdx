## What This Covers

This page explains the two ways to trigger your agent: schedules (time-based) and event triggers (app-based). You'll learn how each works and when to use them.

## Two Types of Triggers

| Type | How it works | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Schedule** | Runs at specific times (daily, weekly, monthly) | Reports, summaries, regular tasks |
| **Event** | Runs when something happens in an app | Reacting to emails, form submissions, updates |

<Info>
**Important:** Agents can have either a schedule OR an event trigger—not both at the same time. To switch trigger types, disable the current one first.
</Info>

## Schedule Triggers

Schedule triggers run your agent at specific times you configure.

### Setting Up a Schedule

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open trigger settings">
    Click **Add Trigger** (⚡) in the topbar, then select **Schedule**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose frequency">
    Select how often to run:
    - **Daily:** Runs every day at the same time
    - **Weekly:** Runs on selected days of the week
    - **Monthly:** Runs on selected days of the month
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the time">
    Choose what time the agent should run. Your timezone is auto-detected, or you can select a different one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select days (if applicable)">
    - **Weekly:** Check which days (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
    - **Monthly:** Check which dates (1st, 15th, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable">
    Click **Enable** to activate. The schedule starts immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Schedule Indicators

When a schedule is active, you'll see:
- A **blue pill** in the topbar showing the schedule (e.g., "Daily at 9:00 AM")
- **Next run time** displayed in the schedule settings

### Managing Schedules

| Action | How to do it |
|--------|-------------|
| View schedule | Click the blue schedule pill in topbar |
| Change settings | Click schedule pill → adjust time/frequency |
| Disable temporarily | Click schedule pill → **Disable** |
| Remove entirely | Click schedule pill → **Remove schedule** |

<Tip>
Disabling a schedule preserves your settings. You can re-enable it later without reconfiguring.
</Tip>

## Event Triggers

Event triggers run your agent when something happens in a connected app—like receiving an email, a new row in a spreadsheet, or a message in Slack.

### Available Events

Common event triggers include:

| App | Example Triggers |
|-----|-----------------|
| Gmail | New email received, New email with label |
| Google Sheets | New row added, Row updated |
| Slack | New message in channel, New direct message |
| Calendar | New event created, Event starting soon |
| GitHub | New issue, New pull request |
| Forms | Form submission received |

<Info>
Not all apps have event triggers. When configuring a trigger, you'll see which events are available for each app.
</Info>

### Setting Up an Event Trigger

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open trigger settings">
    Click **Add Trigger** (⚡) in the topbar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse triggers">
    You'll see two sections:
    - **Your Apps:** Triggers for apps already in your agent
    - **All Apps:** Triggers for any available app
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a trigger">
    Click the event you want (e.g., "New Gmail Message").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure (if needed)">
    Some triggers have configuration options:
    - Gmail: Filter by label or sender
    - Sheets: Specify which spreadsheet
    - Slack: Choose the channel
    
    Fill in required fields (marked with *).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect the app">
    If you haven't connected this app yet, you'll be prompted to sign in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Let's go!** to save the trigger.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Draft vs Live

Event triggers have two states:

| State | Indicator | What happens |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Draft** | Amber/yellow pill | Trigger saved but not active. Agent won't run automatically. |
| **Live** | Green pill with pulse | Trigger active. Agent runs when event occurs. |

### Publishing Your Trigger

After saving, your trigger starts as **Draft**. To activate:

1. The **Publish** button appears in the topbar
2. Click **Publish** to go live
3. Status changes to green "Live" indicator

To pause automatic runs, click the Live indicator → **Unpublish**. Your trigger returns to Draft mode.

### Testing Event Triggers

Before publishing, test with real event data:

1. Click **Test** (🚀) in the topbar
2. A "Listening for trigger" modal appears
3. Perform the action (send an email, add a row, etc.)
4. When detected, your agent runs with the real data
5. Review the results before publishing

<Warning>
Test sessions expire after a few minutes. If no event is detected, click Test again to start a new session.
</Warning>

## Switching Trigger Types

You can't have both a schedule and event trigger active simultaneously.

**To switch from schedule to event trigger:**
1. Click the schedule pill → **Remove schedule**
2. Click **Add Trigger** → select your event

**To switch from event trigger to schedule:**
1. Click the trigger pill → **Remove trigger**
2. Click **Add Trigger** → select **Schedule**

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Can't enable schedule | Event trigger exists | Remove event trigger first |
| Can't add event trigger | Schedule is active | Disable or remove schedule first |
| Trigger not firing | Still in Draft mode | Click Publish to go Live |
| Event not detected | App not connected | Check Accounts in topbar |
| Wrong data captured | Trigger misconfigured | Review trigger settings (labels, filters, etc.) |
