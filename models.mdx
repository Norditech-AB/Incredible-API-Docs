We build AI models optimized for one metric: **getting real work done**. Not chasing benchmark scores or abstract intelligence tests — but practical, reliable performance on real-world tasks.

**You don't choose the model** — our API automatically selects the best model for each request. This lets us continuously improve performance without requiring any changes on your end.
