description: 'Overview of Incredible API agentic models and how to get started'
---

The Incredible API provides agentic models designed for executing tasks through code. These models can reason with data, interact with APIs, and perform complex analysis while maintaining compatibility with standard LLM interfaces.

Our models execute live code to call functions, handling workflows that would typically require multiple LLM calls or human intervention. They perform actions in parallel, chain operations together, maintain context across steps, and adapt based on results—from simple API calls to complex multi-system integrations.
