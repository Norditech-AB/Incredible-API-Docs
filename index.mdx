---

Welcome to Incredible — where we build AI that can work, not just talk.

Build AI that gets real work done — not just chat. Incredible combines agentic models with direct integrations so you can ship assistants that act, automate, and deliver outcomes.

While building agentic automation, we innovated in agentic AI and created state‑of‑the‑art agentic models, outperforming typical stacks (LangChain, MCPs, etc.) and frontier models in the metric that matters: task completion rate. We’re now releasing these agentic models in the Incredible API.

## Why teams choose Incredible

- Code as reasoning and action — the model reads and writes code to analyze data and call APIs.
- Purpose‑built for tools — structured function calling and robust error handling.
- Integrations built‑in — connect to 500+ apps to take real actions.
- Drop‑in compatible — switch from OpenAI/Anthropic in a few lines.

## Model lineup

- Incredible Tiny — lightweight, fast. Great for routing and helpers.
- Incredible Small — balanced cost/performance for most agentic tasks.
- Incredible Big — strong reasoning and tool use for complex flows.
- Incredible Huge — maximum capability for demanding automations.

## What this enables

- Parallelize thousands of actions reliably.
- Use real data instead of hallucinating.
- Keep long‑running tasks on track with memory.

## Let’s break down Incredible

- Category dominance in “AI that can work.” Everyone builds “AI that can talk.” We build “AI that can work.”
- The company: Incredible is a Swedish applied AI lab building Agentic Automation.
- The value of automation: AI Agents are the holy grail of automation — potentially allowing anyone to automate.

## The story

- Incredible Tiny — Matching Gemini 2.5 Flash intelligence. Outperforms in agentic benchmarks. (internally powered by GPT‑5 Nano)
- Incredible Small — Matching Gemini 2.5 Pro intelligence. Outperforms in agentic benchmarks. (internally powered by GLM)
- Incredible Big — Matching Claude 4.0 Sonnet intelligence. Outperforms in agentic benchmarks. (internally powered by Claude 4.0 Sonnet)
- Incredible Huge — Outperforms Claude 4.1 Opus and GPT‑5 in agentic benchmarks. (internally powered by GPT‑5)

While others optimize for MMLU scores and creative writing, we optimize for the metric that matters: task completion rate — solving real‑world problems.

## Creating sales advantages

<Callout>
“Here’s an on‑premise Agentic model achieving SOTA, that can connect to internal and external APIs — tailored to your market, easy to set up.”

Most enterprise solutions require $10m+ investments in hard‑to‑get infrastructure such as A100s. Our agentic models can run on a laptop.
</Callout>

With our technology, it takes only hours to optimize an Agentic model for a specific role or function (e.g., sales, accounting). That means we can release a custom, SOTA agentic model tailored for each market — and for each enterprise — in a couple of hours. Available on‑premise on servers or even laptops.

## What makes it work (deeper)

### Others

- Text as reasoning: produce more tokens before acting.
- Text as action: single function calls via tool bridges/MCPs.
- Raw text inputs: emails/transactions as unstructured blobs.
- Heavy truncation: context limits block real work.

### Us

- “Code as reasoning” — combine foundational text reasoning with on‑demand live code analysis.
- “Code as action” — the model writes code to take action, reference data, and call APIs.
- “Intelligent truncation” — abstract representations (summaries, structure, snippets) to preserve breadth.
- “Self‑maintaining memory” — the model manages its own memory via code to deep‑dive large datasets without blowing context.

## Additional value and positioning

- Much lower cost for data‑driven tasks.
- Direct connections to APIs.
- Drop‑in replacement for OpenAI/Anthropic APIs (switch in a few lines).
- Price and tool‑use performance advantage → rapid adoption.

> Incredible models are optimized for tool use and function calling. For pure chat or creative writing, use traditional LLMs. For getting actual work done with tools and APIs, we’re 10× better.
