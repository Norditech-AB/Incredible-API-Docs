Welcome to the Incredible API documentation. Build powerful AI agents and automations that can interact with hundreds of applications and services.

## What is Incredible?

Incredible is an AI automation platform that lets you create agents with just a sentence. Write a task description in plain English, set a schedule, and you've got a fully functioning Agent that can:

- **Interact with external applications** like Gmail, Excel, CRMs, and more
- **Search the web** and analyze information
- **Generate content** and draw insights
- **Take actions** in connected apps automatically

## Quick Start

### 1. Create Your First Agent

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/agents" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Daily Email Summarizer",
    "description": "Compile overnight emails from Gmail and create a summary in Todoist",
    "schedule": "everyday at 07:00",
    "user_id": "your_user_id"
  }'
```

### 2. Connect Integrations

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/integrations/gmail/connect" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "your_user_id",
    "callback_url": "https://backend.viss.ai/app-auth/oauth2-callback"
  }'
```

### 3. Execute Actions

```bash
