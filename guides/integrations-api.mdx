title: 'Integrations API'
description: 'Use third-party services through the agent with function calling'
---

The Incredible API provides access to dozens of third-party services through intelligent function calling. Instead of making direct API calls, you describe what you want to accomplish, and the agent chooses the right integration tools to get it done.

## 🎯 **How It Works**

1. **Describe Your Goal**: Tell the agent what you want to accomplish
2. **Agent Chooses Tools**: The AI selects the right integration functions
3. **Automatic Execution**: Functions run with proper authentication and parameters
4. **Smart Results**: Get back exactly what you need, not raw API responses

### Example 1: Customer Onboarding Automation

Instead of manually sending welcome emails and creating calendar invites:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "small-1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "We just signed up a new customer: John Smith (john@acme.com). Send them a welcome email with our getting started guide, then schedule an onboarding call for next Tuesday at 2 PM. Also add them to our customer Slack channel."
      }
    ]
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion",
    json={
        "model": "small-1",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "We just signed up a new customer: John Smith (john@acme.com). Send them a welcome email with our getting started guide, then schedule an onboarding call for next Tuesday at 2 PM. Also add them to our customer Slack channel."
            }
        ]
    }
)
print(response.json())
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "small-1",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "We just signed up a new customer: John Smith (john@acme.com). Send them a welcome email with our getting started guide, then schedule an onboarding call for next Tuesday at 2 PM. Also add them to our customer Slack channel."
      }
    ]
  })
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**What the Agent Does:**
1. Sends personalized welcome email via Gmail
2. Creates calendar event and sends invite via Google Calendar
3. Adds John to customer Slack channel
4. Confirms all actions completed successfully

### Example 2: Project Status Report

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "small-1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Create a project status report for Q4. Pull data from our GitHub repositories, Jira tickets, and Mixpanel analytics. Include: open issues count, recent commits, user engagement metrics, and upcoming milestones. Format it nicely in Google Docs and share it with the team on Slack."
      }
    ]
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(

            }
        ]
    }
)
print(response.json())
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "small-1",

  -d '{
    "model": "small-1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "We have 25 leads from last week'\''s webinar who haven'\''t responded. Create a follow-up campaign in Lemlist: send them a personalized email with the webinar recording, schedule a demo call for next week, and track their engagement. Also update their status in HubSpot."
      }
    ]
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python

## 💡 **Best Practices**

### **Be Specific**
❌ "Send an email"
✅ "Send a welcome email to john@example.com with our onboarding guide and schedule a 30-minute intro call for next Tuesday"

### **Use Natural Language**
❌ "Create Gmail integration with SMTP settings"
✅ "Send a personalized follow-up email to webinar attendees who haven't responded"

### **Let the Agent Decide**
❌ "Use the Gmail API to send an email"
✅ "Notify the team about the new product launch and schedule a demo"

### **Combine Multiple Actions**
❌ "Create a document, then send it separately"
✅ "Create a quarterly report with data from GitHub, Jira, and Mixpanel, then share it with stakeholders and schedule a review meeting"

### **Think in Workflows**
❌ "Update the CRM, then send an email, then schedule a call"
✅ "Follow up with our top 10 leads from last month's campaign"
