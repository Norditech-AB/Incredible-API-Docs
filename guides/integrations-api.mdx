title: 'Integrations API'
description: 'Use third-party services through the agent with function calling'
---

The Incredible API provides access to dozens of third-party services through intelligent function calling. Instead of making direct API calls, you describe what you want to accomplish, and the agent chooses the right integration tools to get it done.

## üéØ **How It Works**

1. **Describe Your Goal**: Tell the agent what you want to accomplish
2. **Agent Chooses Tools**: The AI selects the right integration functions
3. **Automatic Execution**: Functions run with proper authentication and parameters
4. **Smart Results**: Get back exactly what you need, not raw API responses

## üîó **Available Integrations**

The agent has access to **50+ integrations** including:

- **Communication**: Gmail, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp
- **Productivity**: Google Calendar, Notion, Confluence, SharePoint
- **Business**: QuickBooks, HubSpot, Salesforce, Stripe
- **Creative**: Canva, Figma, Abyssale, All-Images AI
- **Development**: GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear
- **Analytics**: Mixpanel, Google Analytics, Amplitude
- **Social Media**: TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram

## üöÄ **Real Examples**

### Example 1: Send an Email

Instead of learning Gmail's API, just ask the agent:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "small-1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Send an email to john@example.com with subject 'Meeting Tomorrow' and body 'Hi John, let'\''s meet tomorrow at 2 PM to discuss the project.'"
      }
    ]
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion",
    json={
        "model": "small-1",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Send an email to john@example.com with subject 'Meeting Tomorrow' and body 'Hi John, let's meet tomorrow at 2 PM to discuss the project.'"
            }
        ]
    }
)
print(response.json())
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "small-1",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Send an email to john@example.com with subject 'Meeting Tomorrow' and body 'Hi John, let's meet tomorrow at 2 PM to discuss the project.'"
      }
    ]
  })
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**What Happens:**
1. Agent recognizes you want to send an email
2. Automatically selects Gmail integration tools
3. Handles authentication and API calls
4. Returns confirmation of email sent

### Example 2: Schedule a Meeting

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "small-1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 3 PM with Sarah and Mike to discuss Q4 planning. Make it 1 hour long."
      }
    ]
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion",
    json={
        "model": "small-1",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 3 PM with Sarah and Mike to discuss Q4 planning. Make it 1 hour long."
            }
        ]
    }
)
print(response.json())
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "small-1",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Schedule a meeting tomorrow at 3 PM with Sarah and Mike to discuss Q4 planning. Make it 1 hour long."
      }
    ]
  })
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
console.log(data);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**What Happens:**
1. Agent understands you want to schedule a meeting
2. Uses Google Calendar integration to create the event
3. Automatically finds Sarah and Mike's contact info
4. Sends calendar invites and confirms scheduling

### Example 3: Create a Document

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Shell
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "small-1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Create a Google Doc titled 'Project Summary' with the content: 'This project aims to improve user experience through better integration design. Key milestones include user research, design iteration, and implementation.'"
      }
    ]
  }'
  ```

  ```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion",
    json={
        "model": "small-1",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Create a Google Doc titled 'Project Summary' with the content: 'This project aims to improve user experience through better integration design. Key milestones include user research, design iteration, and implementation.'"
            }
        ]
    }
)
print(response.json())
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "small-1",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Create a Google Doc titled 'Project Summary' with the content: 'This project aims to improve user experience through better integration design. Key milestones include user research, design iteration, and implementation.'"
      }
    ]
  })
});
const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**What Happens:**
1. Agent recognizes you want to create a document
2. Uses Google Docs integration to create the file
3. Formats content properly and sets the title
4. Returns the document ID and sharing link

## üé® **Advanced Workflows**

### Multi-Step Operations

The agent can handle complex workflows automatically:

```
User: "Create a project summary document, then share it with the team on Slack, and schedule a review meeting for next week"
```

**Agent automatically:**
1. Creates Google Doc with project summary
2. Posts link to Slack with team notification
3. Schedules review meeting in Google Calendar
4. Sends calendar invites to team members

### Data Analysis & Reporting

```
User: "Analyze our Mixpanel data for the last 30 days and create a report showing user engagement trends"
```

**Agent automatically:**
1. Queries Mixpanel for user engagement metrics
2. Processes and analyzes the data
3. Creates a formatted report in Google Docs
4. Shares insights and recommendations

  <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Don't learn 50+ APIs - just describe what you want to accomplish, and let the agent handle the complexity of choosing the right tools and executing them properly.
