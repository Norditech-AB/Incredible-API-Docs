### Basic Calculator Functions

Let’s start off simple. While you wouldn’t typically use the API just for math, it clearly shows how Incredible can execute precise operations beyond plain text generation.

```bash
curl https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model": "small-1",
    "functions": [
      {
        "name": "calculate",
        "description": "Perform mathematical calculations with high precision",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "expression": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "Mathematical expression to evaluate (e.g., '\''2 + 2'\'')"
            }
          },
          "required": ["expression"]
        }
      }
    ],
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Calculate the compound interest on $10,000 at 5% annual rate for 3 years"
      }
    ]
  }
```
