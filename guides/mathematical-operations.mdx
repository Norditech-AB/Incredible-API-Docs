### Basic Calculator Functions

Let's start off simple. While you wouldn't typically use the API just for math, it clearly shows how Incredible can execute precise operations beyond plain text generation.

### Example Scenarios

1. **User:** “What’s 25 × 4?”  
   → AI calls calculate with `expression="25 * 4"`  
   **AI:** “The answer is 100.”

2. **User:** “What is (50 + 20) ÷ 7?”  
   → AI calls calculate with `expression="(50 + 20) / 7"`  
   **AI:** “The result is 10.”

3. **User:** “Find the square root of 144.”  
   → AI calls calculate with `expression="sqrt(144)"`  
   **AI:** “The square root is 12.”

4. **User:** “How much is 15% of 200?”  
   → AI calls calculate with `expression="200 * 0.15"`  
   **AI:** “The answer is 30.”
