The Incredible API is an **agentic AI** that can execute code and perform tasks, not just generate text. Here's what makes it unique:

## ðŸ¤– What is Agentic AI?

**Traditional LLMs** (like ChatGPT):
- Generate text based on training data
- Cannot execute code or perform actions
- Limited to providing information

**Incredible (Agentic AI)**:
- Can run actual Python code
- Executes functions and tools
- Performs real-world tasks
- Maintains context across conversations

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### 1. **Code Execution**
Incredible can run Python code to solve problems:

```
User: "What's the weather in New York?"
Incredible: *Actually calls a weather API and returns real data*
```

### 2. **Function Calling**
Define custom functions that Incredible can use:

```json
{
  "name": "calculate_distance",
  "description": "Calculate distance between two points",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "lat1": {"type": "number"},
      "lon1": {"type": "number"},
      "lat2": {"type": "number"},
      "lon2": {"type": "number"}
    },
    "required": ["lat1", "lon1", "lat2", "lon2"]
  }
}
```

### 3. **Context Awareness**
Incredible remembers previous interactions and builds on them:

```
User: "Get the weather in New York"
Assistant: "Current temperature: 72Â°F, sunny"
User: "What should I wear?"
Assistant: "With 72Â°F and sunny conditions, I'd recommend light clothing and sunscreen."
```

## ðŸŽ¯ When to Use Incredible

**Perfect for:**
- Data analysis and processing
- API integrations
- Mathematical calculations
- Multi-step workflows

**Not ideal for:**
- Simple Q&A
- Creative writing
- Static information lookup

  <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Incredible doesn't just talk about doing thingsâ€”it actually does them by running code and calling functions.
