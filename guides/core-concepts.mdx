## 🎯 **What Makes Incredible Different**

Incredible API combines three powerful capabilities that set it apart from traditional AI APIs:

### 1. **Code Execution**
Unlike standard LLMs that only generate text, Incredible can execute actual code and perform real actions. This means it can:
- Run calculations and mathematical operations
- Process data and perform analysis
- Execute custom functions you define
- Interact with external systems and APIs

### 2. **Function Calling**
Incredible can intelligently choose and call functions based on your requests:
- Define custom functions with JSON schemas
- Let the AI decide when and how to use them
- Handle complex workflows with multiple function calls
- Maintain context across function executions

### 3. **Integrations API**
Built-in connections to popular third-party services:
- **Gmail**: Send emails and manage mailboxes
- **Perplexity**: Access real-time search and information
- **Custom Integrations**: Connect to any service via unified endpoints
- **Multiple Auth Methods**: OAuth2, API keys, and more

## 🚀 **When to Use Incredible**

Choose Incredible when you need:
- **Real Actions**: Not just text generation, but actual task execution
- **Complex Workflows**: Multi-step processes that require decision-making
- **External Integrations**: Connect to other services and APIs
- **Agentic Behavior**: AI that can plan, execute, and adapt
