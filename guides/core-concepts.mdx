This page gives you a quick mental model for how Incredible works end to end.

```mermaid

  A[Client App] --> B[Chat Completion]
  B --> C{Model}
  C -->|Respond| D[Assistant Message]
  C -->|Function Call| E[Your Backend]
  E -->|Execute| F[(Integrations / APIs / DBs)]
  E -->|Result| B
```

Key points:
- The model can respond directly or emit function calls.
- Your backend executes functions and returns results to continue the conversation.
- Integrations allow actions in external apps securely on behalf of users.
