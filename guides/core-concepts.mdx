- **Agents**: Longâ€‘lived automations driven by prompts and schedules.
- **Integrations**: Connected apps (e.g., Gmail) that expose executable features.
- **Features**: Concrete actions an integration can perform (e.g., `gmail_send_email`).
- **Chat Completion**: Core endpoint that generates text and orchestrates tool use.
