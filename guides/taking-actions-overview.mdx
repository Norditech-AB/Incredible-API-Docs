AI excels at generating text, but real-world tasks often require **actions** beyond words—like calling a weather API for current conditions instead of providing outdated information.

**Live-code Function Calling** enables these actions by giving AI access to functions it can use when user requests match those capabilities.

## What is Function Calling?

Think of functions as recipes with:

- **Name** and **description**
- **Parameters** (required inputs)
- **Action** the AI can take

When users make requests, the AI decides whether to respond directly or use available functions.

## What is Live-code?

Our agentic models perform function calling by writing code in real-time. This allows them to reference data, perform analysis, and call functions in more sophisticated ways.
