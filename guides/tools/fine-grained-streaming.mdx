Use streaming responses with Server‑Sent Events (SSE) while allowing the assistant to interleave function calls. Buffer partial chunks and only execute functions when the function call payload is complete and validated.

## Pattern

1. Start a streaming Chat Completion with `stream: true`
2. Accumulate tokens from the stream
3. Pause when a function call is emitted
4. Execute the function and send result in a follow‑up request
5. Resume the conversation or stream the final answer

## Tips

- Keep streamed chunks small for responsive UIs
- Debounce updates in the client
- Surface intermediate states ("thinking", "calling function", etc.)
