Use streaming responses with Server‑Sent Events (SSE) while allowing the assistant to interleave tool calls.

## Pattern

1. Start a streaming Chat Completion with `stream: true`
2. Accumulate tokens from the stream
3. Pause when a tool call is emitted
4. Execute the tool and send result in a follow‑up request
5. Resume the conversation or stream the final answer

## Tips

- Keep streamed chunks small for responsive UIs
- Debounce updates in the client
- Surface intermediate states ("thinking", "calling tool", etc.)
