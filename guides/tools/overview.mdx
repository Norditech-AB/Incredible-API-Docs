description: "How to use function calling (tools) with the Incredible API"
---

Function calling ("tools") lets your assistant request that your application perform actions and return structured results.

### Two types of functions

- **User defined functions**: The ones you can enter into the API.
- **System functions**: Right now it's only the "analysis" function.

<Expandable title="Single tool example">
  A single tool is invoked to answer the user's request.

  ```bash
  curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $INCREDIBLE_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
      "model": "small-1",
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in San Francisco?"}],
      "functions": [{
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
        "parameters": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {"type": "string", "description": "City and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"}
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }]
    }'
  ```
</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Sequential tools">
  Multiple tools are available; the model can call them in sequence.

  ```bash
  curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $INCREDIBLE_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
      "model": "small-1",
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What\'s the weather right now where I am?"}],
      "functions": [
        {
          "name": "get_location",
          "description": "Resolve the user\'s current city from IP",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"ip": {"type": "string", "description": "User IP address"}}
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "get_weather",
          "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
          "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {"location": {"type": "string"}},
            "required": ["location"]
          }
        }
      ]
    }'
  ```

### Live‑code function calling

- **We**: write code to take actions. We can take very complex actions, reference data, and more. Basically anything you can do with code is now possible.
- **Others**: write JSON to take actions. The LLM must copy and write out everything manually. It messes up, it's slow, and it can't make complex actions (for example, creating a huge spreadsheet with analysis is not possible).

### Integrations

- **We**: have built‑in integrations to 500+ apps, and optimized our agentic models that do real work.
- **Others**: have MCPs, which means you have to build it and set it up, host it, etc.
