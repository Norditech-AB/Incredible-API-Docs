title: "How to Implement Tool Use"
description: "Define tools, detect tool calls, execute them, and return results"

This guide shows the end‑to‑end flow for client‑executed tools and mirrors the flow described in Anthropic’s overview, adapted to Incredible’s chat API.

## 1) Define tools

Provide a `name`, `description`, and `parameters` JSON schema for each tool in your Chat Completion request.

## 2) Detect tool calls

When the model wants to use a tool, it returns a tool call in the response content. Inspect the response and extract the tool name and inputs.

## 3) Execute tool

Run the tool code on your backend. Handle validation, errors, authentication, and rate limits as needed.

## 4) Return results

Post the result back in the next message (as part of the conversation) so the assistant can incorporate it into its final response.

## Tips

- Keep inputs minimal and typed via JSON schema
- Fail fast with actionable error messages
- Avoid long‑running tools; offload to background jobs when needed
- Sanitize any user‑provided inputs
