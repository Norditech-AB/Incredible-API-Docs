title: "How to Implement Function Use"
description: "Define functions, detect function calls, execute them, and return results"
---

This guide shows the end‑to‑end flow for client‑executed functions and mirrors the flow described in Anthropic’s overview, adapted to Incredible’s chat API.

## 1) Define functions

Provide a `name`, `description`, and `parameters` JSON schema for each function in your Chat Completion request.

## 2) Detect function calls

When the model wants to use a function, it returns a function call in the response content. Inspect the response and extract the function name and inputs.

## 3) Execute function

Run the function code on your backend. Handle validation, errors, authentication, and rate limits as needed.

## 4) Return results

Post the result back in the next message (as part of the conversation) so the assistant can incorporate it into its final response.

## Tips

- Keep inputs minimal and typed via JSON schema
- Fail fast with actionable error messages
- Avoid long‑running functions; offload to background jobs when needed
- Sanitize any user‑provided inputs
