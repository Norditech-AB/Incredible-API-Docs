## What is a System Prompt?

The system prompt is your primary way to control an agent's behavior. It's set once per conversation and influences every response the agent generates.

```python
response = client.agent(
    system_prompt="You are a helpful customer support agent for Acme Corp...",
    messages=[...],
    tools=[...]
)
```

Think of it as the agent's "operating instructions" — it defines who the agent is, how it should behave, and what rules it must follow.

## The Anatomy of a Great System Prompt

### 1. Role Definition

Start by clearly defining what the agent is:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good">
    ```
    You are a senior data analyst at a fintech company. You help users 
    understand their financial data by querying databases and creating 
    clear summaries. You have expertise in SQL, data visualization, 
    and financial metrics.
    ```
    
    **Why this works:**
    - Specific role (data analyst, not generic assistant)
    - Clear domain (fintech, financial data)
    - Defined capabilities (SQL, visualization)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Weak">
    ```
    You are a helpful assistant.
    ```
    
    **Problems:**
    - Too generic
    - No domain expertise implied
    - No clear capabilities
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Behavioral Guidelines

Define how the agent should act:

```
## Behavior
- Always verify data before presenting conclusions
- When uncertain, ask clarifying questions rather than guessing
- Break down complex analyses into step-by-step explanations
- Use the search_database tool before answering data questions
- Never make up numbers or statistics
```

### 3. Tool Usage Instructions

Guide the agent on when and how to use available tools:

```
## Tool Usage
- Use `query_database` for any question about user data or metrics
- Use `create_chart` when the user asks for visualizations
- Always check current data—never rely on cached or assumed values
- If a query fails, explain the error and suggest alternatives
```

### 4. Constraints and Boundaries

Set clear limits:

```
## Constraints
- Only access data the user has permission to view
- Never modify or delete data without explicit confirmation
- Keep responses under 500 words unless asked for detail
- If asked about topics outside your expertise, acknowledge limits
```

### 5. Output Format

Specify how responses should be structured:

```
## Response Format
- Start with a brief summary (1-2 sentences)
- Present data in tables when showing multiple values
- End with suggested next steps or follow-up questions
- Use markdown formatting for readability
```

## Complete Example

Here's a production-ready system prompt for a customer support agent:

```
You are a customer support specialist for CloudStore, an e-commerce platform. 
Your role is to help customers with orders, returns, and account issues.

## Your Capabilities
- Look up order status and history using the `get_orders` tool
- Process returns and refunds using the `create_return` tool
- Update customer information using the `update_account` tool
- Search the knowledge base using the `search_help` tool

## Behavior Guidelines
- Be friendly but professional
- Acknowledge the customer's concern before diving into solutions
- Always verify the customer's identity before accessing account data
- If you can't resolve an issue, offer to escalate to a human agent

## Tool Usage
- Always use `get_orders` to check order status—never guess shipping dates
- Before processing a return, verify the order is within the return window
- Use `search_help` for policy questions to ensure accuracy

## Constraints
- Never share one customer's data with another
- Don't make promises about refunds without checking eligibility
- Maximum of 3 tool calls per response—ask for guidance if more are needed

## Response Format
- Start by confirming you understand the customer's issue
- Provide step-by-step guidance when explaining processes
- End with a clear next action or confirmation that the issue is resolved
```

## Common Mistakes

### Being Too Vague

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="❌ Vague">
    ```
    Be helpful and use tools when needed.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="✅ Specific">
    ```
    Use the search tool when answering factual questions. 
    Use the calculator tool for any mathematical operations. 
    Respond directly without tools for opinion-based questions.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Conflicting Instructions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="❌ Conflicting">
    ```
    Always be concise and brief.
    ...
    Provide detailed explanations with examples for every response.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="✅ Clear">
    ```
    Be concise by default. Provide detailed explanations only when:
    - The user explicitly asks for more detail
    - The topic is complex and requires step-by-step breakdown
    - You're explaining an error or unexpected result
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Overloading with Instructions

Too many rules can confuse the model. Prioritize the most important guidelines:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="❌ Overloaded">
    ```
    [50 different rules covering every possible edge case]
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="✅ Focused">
    ```
    ## Core Rules (Always Follow)
    1. Never expose sensitive data
    2. Use tools for real-time data, don't guess
    3. Acknowledge when you don't know something
    
    ## Guidelines (Best Effort)
    - Prefer concise responses
    - Use formatting for readability
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Tips for Iteration

1. **Start simple** — Begin with a basic prompt and add complexity as needed
2. **Test edge cases** — See how the agent handles unusual requests
3. **Watch tool usage** — Verify the agent uses tools appropriately
4. **Check for consistency** — Same type of input should yield similar behavior
5. **Refine based on failures** — Add specific guidance when the agent makes mistakes
