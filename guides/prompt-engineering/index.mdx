## Why Prompt Engineering Matters

The difference between a mediocre AI integration and a great one often comes down to how you communicate with the model. Well-crafted prompts lead to:

- **More accurate responses** — The model understands exactly what you need
- **Consistent behavior** — Reliable outputs across different inputs
- **Better tool usage** — Agents call the right tools with correct arguments
- **Reduced costs** — Fewer retries and failed interactions

## Quick Reference

### The Prompt Quality Checklist

<Check>**Specific** — Avoids vague terms like "good" or "appropriate"</Check>
<Check>**Structured** — Uses clear formatting (lists, sections, examples)</Check>
<Check>**Contextual** — Provides relevant background information</Check>
<Check>**Constrained** — Defines boundaries and limitations</Check>
<Check>**Testable** — Can verify if the output meets requirements</Check>

### Before You Start

The Agent API uses three key areas where prompt engineering applies:

1. **System Prompt** — Defines the agent's role, behavior, and constraints
2. **Tool Descriptions** — Tells the agent what each tool does and when to use it
3. **User Messages** — The actual requests and context you send

Each area has different best practices, covered in the guides above.
