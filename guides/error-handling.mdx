Use these patterns to make your integrations resilient.

### Quick checklist
- Validate input before requests
- Check HTTP status codes and error bodies
- Retry transient errors with backoff
- Log request IDs and timestamps for support

### Common errors

| Status | Error                         | When it happens                                 | How to fix |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 400    | Messages are required         | `messages` missing or empty                      | Provide at least one user message |
| 401    | Unauthorized                  | Missing/invalid API key                          | Set `Authorization: Bearer $INCREDIBLE_API_KEY` |
| 404    | Integration not found         | Wrong `integration_id`                           | Verify the ID via List/Get Integrations |
| 429    | Rate limited                  | Too many requests                                | Exponential backoff and jitter |
| 500    | Execution failed              | Upstream/provider errors                          | Retry with backoff; report `request_id` |

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INCREDIBLE_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"model":"small-1","stream":false,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Ping"}]}'
```

> Tip: Include the `request_id` from error responses when contacting support.
