## What are Incredible Agents?

Incredible Agents is an AI automation platform that lets you automate work with just a sentence. Write a task description in plain English, set a schedule, and you’ve got a fully functioning Agent. Agents can interact with external applications like email (e.g., Gmail), spreadsheets (e.g., Excel), CRMs (e.g., Attio), and much more.

## How can I get access to Incredible?

We’re currently in Closed Beta, with access limited to a select group of early users. Every week, we invite a new batch. Join the waitlist to secure early access and start automating your work before everyone else.

## Do I need to be technical to work with Agents?

Not at all. Our vision is to make automation accessible to everyone—and with Incredible Agents, we’ve made that happen. If you can describe your task and name the apps involved, you can build Agents. No coding required.

## What can you do with Incredible Agents?

Incredible Agents handle the tasks you wish you had time for. For example, set up an Agent to analyze your customer support tickets daily and send you a summary in Slack. From routine reporting to intelligent insights, Agents work for you—even when you’re not watching.

## How do Agents work?

Agents take actions by writing live-code, meaning they can make use of data and perform complex tasks. This can range from performing statistical analysis on 100,000 financial transactions, or drawing pictures in Google Sheets. Before they start on a task, they first write down the approach they are going to take, and then follow it until they’re done with the task.
