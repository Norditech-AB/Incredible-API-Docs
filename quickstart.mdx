The fastest way to try Incredible is a single cURL call.

## 1) Set your API key

```bash
export INCREDIBLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## 2) Hello, Incredible (non‑streaming)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INCREDIBLE_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model":"small-1",
    "stream": false,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hello incredioble!!"}]
  }'
```

That’s it. You’ll get a JSON response with the assistant’s reply in `result.response[0].content`.

Next: explore Examples → Basic Chat for a slightly longer sample, or Tools to learn function calling.
