# Quick Start Guide

Get started with Incredible API and create your first AI agent in minutes. From idea to automation in 30 seconds.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An Incredible API account
- Your API credentials
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

### Get Your API Credentials

1. Sign up at [incredible.one](https://www.incredible.one/)
2. Navigate to your dashboard
3. Generate your API key from the settings

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using npm
npm install incredible-api

# Using pip
pip install incredible-api

# Or use curl for direct API calls
```

## Step 2: Create Your First Agent

Let's create a simple agent that summarizes daily emails.

### Example: Daily Email Summarizer

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.com/v1/agents" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Daily Email Summarizer",
    "description": "Compile overnight emails from Gmail and create a summary in Todoist",
    "schedule": "everyday at 07:00",
    "user_id": "your_user_id",
    "integrations": ["gmail", "todoist"],
    "prompt": "Read all unread emails from Gmail, summarize the key points, and create tasks in Todoist for any actionable items"
  }'
```

### Response

```json
{
  "agent_id": "agent_123456",
  "name": "Daily Email Summarizer",
  "status": "active",
  "schedule": "everyday at 07:00",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Step 3: Connect Integrations

Your agent needs access to the applications it will work with.

### Connect Gmail

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.com/v1/integrations/gmail/connect" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "your_user_id",
    "callback_url": "https://your-app.com/oauth/callback"
  }'
```

### Connect Todoist

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.com/v1/integrations/todoist/connect" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "your_user_id",
    "api_key": "your_todoist_api_key"
  }'
```

## Step 4: Test Your Agent

### Manual Execution

Test your agent immediately without waiting for the schedule:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.com/v1/agents/agent_123456/execute" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "your_user_id"
  }'
```

### Check Execution Status

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.incredible.com/v1/agents/agent_123456/executions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Step 5: Monitor and Optimize

### View Agent Logs

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.incredible.com/v1/agents/agent_123456/logs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Update Agent Configuration

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.incredible.com/v1/agents/agent_123456" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Compile overnight emails from Gmail, summarize key points, and create prioritized tasks in Todoist",
    "schedule": "everyday at 06:30"
  }'
```
