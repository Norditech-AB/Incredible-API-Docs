description: "A complex multi-tool agent workflow from the Cookbook"
---

This example mirrors the advanced workflow in our Cookbook.

Steps covered:
- Tool planning and selection
- Multi-step execution with intermediate state
- Error handling and retries

Open the linked file for the full runnable script.

### Kickoff request (pattern)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "small-1",
    "stream": false,
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Research and draft a brief report; use tools as needed."}
    ],
    "functions": [/* planner, fetch, analyze, format tools */]
  }'
```

The assistant will orchestrate multiple tools in sequence; send back `function_call_result` blocks as each step completes.
