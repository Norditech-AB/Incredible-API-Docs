Illustrates schema-driven extraction and validation.

### 1) Provide an extraction tool

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "small-1",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Extract companies mentioned: Apple acquired Beats for $3B."}],
    "functions": [{
      "name": "extract_entities",
      "description": "Extract companies and amounts",
      "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "companies": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
          "amount": {"type": "string"}
        },
        "required": ["companies"]
      }
    }]
  }'
```

Send `function_call_result` with the extracted JSON to complete the answer.
