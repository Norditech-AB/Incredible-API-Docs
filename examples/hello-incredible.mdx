description: "Your first cURL request with the Incredible Chat API (step‑by‑step)"
---

Kick the tires of the Incredible API in under a minute. This page walks you through a minimal, copy‑paste cURL flow, plus a streaming variant, and where to go next.

## 1) Prerequisites

- An Incredible API key
- curl installed

Set your key as an environment variable:

```bash
export INCREDIBLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

<Note>
Replace the value with your real key from the dashboard. Keep it secret; don’t commit it to source control.
</Note>

## 2) Say hello (non‑streaming)

Send your first request with model `small-1` and get a complete response:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INCREDIBLE_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "small-1",
    "stream": false,
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Incredible!" }
    ]
  }'
```

You’ll receive a JSON body where the assistant’s reply is in `result.response[0].content`.

## 3) See it live (streaming)

Switch to streaming to see the answer arrive as it’s generated.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/chat-completion" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $INCREDIBLE_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "small-1",
    "stream": true,
    "messages": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "Say hello in one short sentence." }
    ]
  }'
```

When streaming, responses are returned as Server‑Sent Events; chunks terminate with a final `[DONE]` marker.
