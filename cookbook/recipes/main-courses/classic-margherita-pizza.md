## 🥘 Ingredients

### Main Ingredients
- 2 1/4 cups (280g) bread flour - High-protein flour for better gluten development
- 1 cup (240ml) warm water (110°F/43°C) - Lukewarm to activate yeast
- 2 1/4 tsp (7g) active dry yeast - Fresh yeast for optimal rising
- 1 tsp (6g) kosher salt - Enhances flavor and controls yeast
- 1 tbsp (15ml) extra virgin olive oil - Adds richness and prevents sticking
- 8 oz (227g) fresh mozzarella cheese - Fresh, not pre-shredded
- 1/2 cup (120ml) San Marzano tomato sauce - Authentic Italian tomatoes
- 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves - Torn, not chopped, for authentic presentation
- 2 tbsp (30ml) extra virgin olive oil - For drizzling

### Optional/Substitution Ingredients
- 1/4 cup (25g) grated Parmigiano-Reggiano - For extra umami flavor
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes - For subtle heat
- 1 clove garlic, minced - For garlic lovers

## 🛠️ Equipment Needed
- Stand mixer with dough hook - For consistent dough development
- Pizza stone or steel - For authentic crispy crust
- Pizza peel - For transferring pizza to oven
- Digital kitchen scale - For precise measurements
- Instant-read thermometer - For water temperature
- Large mixing bowl - For dough rising
- Plastic wrap - For covering dough during rise

## 📖 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Preparation Phase
1. **Activate Yeast**: In a small bowl, combine warm water and yeast. Let stand for 5-10 minutes until foamy
   - **Pro Tip**: Water should feel warm to the touch, not hot
   - **Common Mistake**: Using water that's too hot kills yeast

2. **Mix Dough**: In stand mixer bowl, combine flour and salt. Add yeast mixture and olive oil
   - **Pro Tip**: Mix on low speed to prevent flour from flying
   - **Common Mistake**: Adding all ingredients at once can cause clumping

3. **Knead Dough**: Mix on medium speed for 8-10 minutes until dough is smooth and elastic
   - **Pro Tip**: Dough should pull away from bowl sides and feel slightly tacky
   - **Common Mistake**: Under-kneading results in dense, tough crust

4. **First Rise**: Place dough in oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, let rise 1-2 hours until doubled
   - **Pro Tip**: Warm, draft-free location speeds rising
   - **Common Mistake**: Over-proofing makes dough collapse

### Cooking Phase
1. **Preheat Oven**: Place pizza stone in oven and preheat to 500°F (260°C) for 1 hour
   - **Pro Tip**: Longer preheating ensures stone reaches full temperature
   - **Common Mistake**: Insufficient preheating results in soggy crust

2. **Shape Dough**: On floured surface, stretch dough into 12-inch circle, leaving thicker edges
   - **Pro Tip**: Use knuckles to stretch, not fingertips
   - **Common Mistake**: Rolling pin compresses dough layers

3. **Add Toppings**: Spread sauce thinly, add torn mozzarella, drizzle with olive oil
   - **Pro Tip**: Less is more - don't overload the pizza
   - **Common Mistake**: Too many toppings make crust soggy

4. **Bake Pizza**: Transfer to hot stone, bake 12-15 minutes until crust is golden and cheese bubbles
   - **Pro Tip**: Rotate pizza halfway through for even cooking
   - **Common Mistake**: Opening oven door too frequently

## 🔍 Visual Cues & Doneness Indicators
- **Visual**: Crust should be golden brown with charred spots, cheese should be melted and slightly browned
- **Texture**: Crust should be crispy on bottom, chewy inside, with airy bubbles
- **Temperature**: Internal temperature should reach 200°F (93°C)
- **Time**: 12-15 minutes total, with rotation at 6-7 minutes

## 🎨 Presentation & Plating
- **Garnish suggestions**: Fresh basil leaves scattered over top, drizzle of olive oil
- **Serving temperature**: Hot, straight from oven
- **Plate selection**: Large wooden cutting board or pizza pan
- **Arrangement**: Cut into 8 slices, arrange with basil garnish visible

## 🍽️ Serving Suggestions
- **Accompaniments**: Simple green salad with balsamic vinaigrette, red wine
- **Beverage pairings**: Chianti, Sangiovese, or light Italian red wine
- **Meal context**: Perfect for casual dinner, pizza night, or entertaining

## 🔄 Variations & Substitutions
- **Margherita Bianca**: Omit tomato sauce, use only mozzarella and basil
- **Spicy Margherita**: Add red pepper flakes and spicy salami
- **Substitution 1**: Use all-purpose flour instead of bread flour (slightly less chewy)
- **Substitution 2**: Substitute fresh mozzarella with low-moisture mozzarella (more traditional)

## 🚨 Allergen Information
- **Contains**: Gluten (wheat), dairy (milk)
- **May contain**: Soy (if using certain flours)
- **Allergen-free alternatives**: Use gluten-free flour blend and vegan mozzarella

## 💡 Tips & Tricks
- **Pro Tip 1**: Let dough rest 10 minutes after mixing before kneading for easier handling
- **Pro Tip 2**: Use a pizza steel instead of stone for even better heat distribution
- **Time-saving tip**: Make dough ahead and refrigerate overnight for deeper flavor
- **Storage tip**: Leftover pizza reheats best in a hot skillet, not microwave

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions
**Q: Can I make this without a pizza stone?**
A: Yes, use a heavy baking sheet turned upside down, but results won't be as crispy.

**Q: Why is my dough not rising?**
A: Check water temperature (should be 110°F/43°C), yeast freshness, and ensure no salt contact with yeast.

**Q: How do I prevent toppings from sliding off?**
A: Don't overload pizza, and ensure sauce is spread thinly and evenly.

## 🔬 Science Behind the Recipe
- **Chemical reactions**: Yeast fermentation produces CO2, creating air pockets in dough
- **Temperature effects**: High oven temperature (500°F) creates Maillard reaction for browning
- **Ingredient interactions**: Gluten proteins in bread flour create elastic network for chewy texture
