## Data Protection

### We Don't Train on Your Data

Your data is yours. Period.

- **Customer content** (prompts, messages, documents, and data from integrated third-party services) is **never** used to train our AI models
- **Operational data** is collected solely for platform optimization, security, and service improvement
- **Integration data** from connected third-party services is processed but never used for training—we may track which services are connected and usage frequency, but not the substance of your data

### Isolated Processing Environments

All task execution occurs in secure, sandboxed environments:

- **Temporary processing** — Business data is processed only for the duration of your request
- **Automatic deletion** — Data is automatically purged upon task completion
- **No cross-contamination** — Each execution environment is isolated from others
