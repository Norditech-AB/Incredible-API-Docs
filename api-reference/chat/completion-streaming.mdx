Show text as it’s produced. Great for chat UIs that display typing and for long answers where users shouldn’t wait for the full result.

#### Response (Streaming)

```text
data: {"content": {"type": "text_chunk", "content": "Hello"}}
data: {"content": {"type": "function_call", "function_call_id": "...", "function_calls": []}}
data: {"content": "[DONE]"}
```
