title: "Execute Integration Feature"
openapi: "POST /v1/integrations/{integration_id}/execute"
---

Execute a specific feature or function from a connected integration. This endpoint is primarily used by agentic models to perform actions through integrations on behalf of users.

## Overview

After connecting to an integration, you can execute its available features by calling this endpoint. Each integration provides different functions - for example, GitHub might offer functions to create issues, while Slack might offer functions to send messages.

## Prerequisites

1. **Integration must be connected** - The user must have successfully connected to the integration
2. **Feature must exist** - The feature name must be in the integration's available functions list
3. **Proper authentication** - User must be authenticated and authorized

## Request Body

### Required Fields
- **user_id** - The ID of the user executing the feature
- **feature_name** - The name of the function to execute

### Optional Fields
- **inputs** - Object containing the parameters needed for the feature

## Available Features

To see what features an integration supports, use the [Get Integration Details](/api-reference/integrations/get-details) endpoint and check the `functions` array.

## Best Practices

1. **Check available features first** - Use the get details endpoint to see what functions are available
2. **Handle errors gracefully** - Always check the response for errors before proceeding
3. **Validate inputs** - Ensure all required parameters are provided for the specific feature
4. **Monitor rate limits** - Some integrations have rate limits that may affect execution
