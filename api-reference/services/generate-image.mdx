- **Personalization** - Custom visuals for user-generated content

## How Image Generation Works

The API uses advanced diffusion models that have been trained on millions of image-text pairs. Here's the generation process:

1. **Prompt Analysis** - Your text description is analyzed to understand subjects, styles, composition, and mood
2. **Latent Generation** - The model generates the image in a compressed latent space
3. **Refinement** - Multiple denoising steps progressively improve image quality
4. **Upscaling** - The final image is upscaled to high resolution
5. **Safety Check** - Content moderation filters are applied
6. **Delivery** - The image is stored temporarily and a URL is returned

**Generation time:** Typically 5-15 seconds depending on complexity and current load.

## Writing Effective Prompts

The quality of your generated images depends heavily on prompt quality. Here are strategies for better results:

### Prompt Structure

**Basic template:**
```
[Subject] [doing/being what] [setting/environment] [style/mood] [technical details]
```

**Examples:**
- "A golden retriever puppy playing in a meadow, soft lighting, photorealistic, 8k"
- "Futuristic cityscape at night, neon lights, cyberpunk style, cinematic composition"
- "Watercolor painting of a lighthouse on rocky coast, pastel colors, impressionist"

### Key Elements

**Subject** - What's the main focus?
- Be specific: "tabby cat" vs "cat"
- Include details: "elderly man with white beard" vs "man"
- Specify quantity: "three colorful hot air balloons"

**Action/State** - What's happening?
- "running through forest"
- "floating in space"
- "sitting peacefully"

**Environment/Setting** - Where is this?
- "in a modern kitchen"
- "on a tropical beach at sunset"
- "deep underwater coral reef"

**Style/Mood** - How should it look?
- Art styles: "oil painting," "digital art," "pencil sketch," "3D render"
- Mood: "dramatic," "peaceful," "energetic," "mysterious"
- Photography: "portrait mode," "wide angle," "macro photography"

**Technical Details** - Quality and composition
- "highly detailed," "8k resolution," "sharp focus"
- "cinematic lighting," "volumetric lighting," "studio lighting"
- "shallow depth of field," "bokeh background"

### Prompt Tips

**Do's:**
- ✅ Be specific and descriptive
- ✅ Use style references ("like Pixar animation")
- ✅ Specify lighting and atmosphere
- ✅ Include composition details ("centered," "close-up," "aerial view")
- ✅ Mention quality ("high quality," "detailed," "professional")

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Use vague descriptions ("nice image," "good looking")
- ❌ Include multiple conflicting styles
- ❌ Over-complicate with too many subjects
- ❌ Use negative instructions (model interprets positively)

## Examples

<CodeGroup>

```python Python SDK
from incredible_python import Incredible

client = Incredible(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.generate_image(
    prompt="A red circle",
    aspect_ratio="1:1"
)

print("Image URL:", response.image_url)
print("Seed:", response.seed)
```

```ts TypeScript SDK
import { IncredibleClient } from '@incredible-ai/sdk';

const client = new IncredibleClient();

const response = await client.images({
  prompt: 'A serene mountain landscape at sunset, digital art style',
  aspect_ratio: '16:9'
});

if (response.success) {
  console.log('Image URL:', response.image_url);
  console.log('Seed:', response.seed);
}
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/generate-image" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A serene mountain landscape at sunset, digital art style",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "output_format": "jpeg"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Request Parameters

### prompt (required)
A detailed text description of the image you want to generate. The more specific and descriptive your prompt, the better the results.

**Prompt length:** 1-2000 characters. Optimal length is 50-200 characters with key details.

**See "Writing Effective Prompts" above for detailed guidance.**

### aspect_ratio (optional)
The dimensions of the generated image. Default: `16:9`.

**Available ratios:**
- `1:1` (Square) - 1024x1024px
  - **Use for:** Social media posts, profile pictures, icons
  - **Platforms:** Instagram posts, Twitter, LinkedIn
  
- `16:9` (Landscape) - 1920x1080px
  - **Use for:** YouTube thumbnails, presentations, website headers
  - **Platforms:** YouTube, blog headers, slides
  
- `9:16` (Portrait) - 1080x1920px
  - **Use for:** Mobile content, Stories, vertical video thumbnails
  - **Platforms:** Instagram Stories, TikTok, Snapchat
  
- `4:3` (Traditional) - 1024x768px
  - **Use for:** Traditional displays, presentations
  - **Classic format for standard content**
  
- `3:4` (Tall portrait) - 768x1024px

  - **Use for:** Full-screen mobile experiences, tall banners
  - **Maximum vertical canvas**

**Tip:** Choose aspect ratio based on your intended use case, not arbitrary preference.

### output_format (optional)
File format for the generated image. Options: `jpeg` (default) or `png`.

**JPEG (default):**
- Smaller file size
- Faster generation
- No transparency
- Best for: Photographs, realistic scenes, web content

**PNG:**
- Larger file size
- Lossless compression
- Supports transparency
- Best for: Graphics with transparency, logos, when quality is critical

**When to use PNG:**
- You need transparent backgrounds
- Image will be further edited
- Absolute quality preservation is required
- File size is not a concern

### seed (optional)
Integer value for reproducible image generation. Range: 0-4,294,967,295.

**How seeds work:**
Using the same seed with the same prompt will generate nearly identical images. This is crucial for:
- **Consistency** - Generate matching images across a series
- **Iteration** - Make minor prompt adjustments while maintaining core image
- **A/B testing** - Test variations systematically
- **Version control** - Recreate exact images later

**Example workflow:**
```python
# Generate initial image
response1 = client.generate_image(prompt="sunset over ocean")
seed = response1.seed  # Save the seed

# Generate similar image with same seed
response2 = client.generate_image(
    prompt="sunset over ocean with sailboat",  # Slightly modified
    seed=seed  # Same seed for consistency
)
```

**Note:** Omit seed for random generation each time.

### prompt_upsampling (optional)
Automatically enhance your prompt for better results. Boolean, default: `false`.

**When enabled:**
- Adds quality modifiers ("highly detailed," "professional quality")
- Improves style consistency
- Adds technical terms for better rendering

**Example transformation:**
- Input: `"mountain landscape"`
- Upsampled: `"majestic mountain landscape with snow-capped peaks, golden hour lighting, highly detailed, professional photography, 8k resolution"`

**When to use:**
- ✅ Short or basic prompts
- ✅ When you want maximum quality automatically
- ✅ For users who aren't prompt engineering experts

**When not to use:**
- ❌ You've already written a detailed prompt
- ❌ You want precise control over every detail
- ❌ Testing specific prompt formulations

### safety_tolerance (optional)
Content moderation level. Range: 0-6, default: `2`.

**Tolerance levels:**
- `0` - Most strict: Blocks anything remotely questionable
- `2` - Moderate (default): Blocks clearly inappropriate content
- `6` - Most permissive: Allows artistic and mature themes

**What's moderated:**
- Violence and gore
- Adult content
- Hate symbols
- Illegal activities
- Harmful or dangerous content

**Recommendations:**
- **0-1:** Children's content, educational materials, public-facing apps
- **2-3:** General purpose applications, business content
- **4-6:** Artistic projects, mature audiences, where context matters

**Note:** Even at high tolerance levels, illegal content is always blocked.

## Best Practices

**Prompt Engineering:**
- Iterate on prompts - first generation rarely perfect
- Use style references from known artists or movements
- Include lighting details for photorealistic images
- Specify camera angles and composition
- Add quality modifiers ("highly detailed," "sharp focus")

**Performance & Cost:**
- Cache frequently used images
- Generate at lower resolutions for prototypes
- Use seeds to avoid regenerating the same image
- Batch similar requests together

**Quality Optimization:**
- Be specific about style and mood
- Include technical photography/art terms
- Experiment with different aspect ratios
- Try prompt_upsampling for automatic enhancement

**Integration Patterns:**
- **Dynamic content** - Generate unique images for each user/session
- **Asset libraries** - Bulk generate variations for design systems
- **Personalization** - Create customized visuals based on user data
- **Rapid prototyping** - Quickly visualize concepts for stakeholder review

## Important Notes

**Image URL Expiry:**
Generated image URLs expire after 1 hour. Always download and save images immediately if you need them long-term.

```python
import requests
from pathlib import Path

# Generate image
response = client.generate_image(prompt="...")

# Download immediately
image_data = requests.get(response.image_url).content
Path("generated_image.jpg").write_bytes(image_data)
```

**Content Policy:**
Images must comply with our content policy. Generations that violate policies will be rejected with an error.

**Rate Limits:**
Image generation is rate limited per API key. Contact support to increase limits for high-volume use cases.
