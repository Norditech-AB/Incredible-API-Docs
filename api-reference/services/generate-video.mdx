## Overview

The Video Generation API creates high-quality short videos from text descriptions or reference images. Powered by advanced AI diffusion models, this endpoint produces smooth, realistic video clips that bring your concepts to life.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Text-to-video** - Generate videos from natural language descriptions
- **Image-to-video** - Animate static images into dynamic videos
- **Multiple resolutions** - From social media to high-definition formats
- **Consistent motion** - Smooth, natural movement and transitions
- **Temporal coherence** - Maintains visual consistency across frames

**Real-world applications:**
- **Social media content** - Create eye-catching videos for posts and Stories
- **Marketing campaigns** - Generate product demos and promotional videos
- **Content creation** - B-roll footage for videos and presentations
- **E-commerce** - Product showcases with dynamic movement
- **Prototyping** - Visualize concepts before expensive production
- **Animation** - Quick animated sequences for various purposes
- **Education** - Visual demonstrations and explainer content

## How Video Generation Works

Video generation is significantly more complex than image generation because it must maintain consistency across multiple frames while creating natural motion:

1. **Prompt/Image Analysis** - Understanding what needs to be generated and how it should move
2. **Motion Planning** - Determining camera movement, object motion, and scene dynamics
3. **Frame Generation** - Creating each frame with temporal consistency
4. **Motion Smoothing** - Ensuring smooth transitions between frames
5. **Upscaling & Enhancement** - Improving quality and resolution
6. **Encoding** - Compressing into MP4 format
7. **Delivery** - Encoded as base64 data URI for transmission

**Generation time:** 1-10 minutes depending on complexity, resolution, and current load. Video generation is computationally intensive—please be patient.

**Video length:** Generated videos are 8 seconds long, providing enough time for a complete action or scene while keeping generation times reasonable.

## Writing Effective Video Prompts

Video prompts require thinking about motion and time, not just static scenes:

### Prompt Structure for Videos

**Template:**
```
[Subject] [action/motion] [environment] [camera movement] [style/mood]
```

**Good video prompts:**
- ✅ "Ocean waves crashing against rocky cliffs, slow motion, cinematic"
- ✅ "Golden retriever running through meadow, camera following, sunny day"
- ✅ "City traffic at night, time lapse, neon lights, aerial view"
- ✅ "Waterfall cascading down mountain, morning mist, drone footage"

**Less effective:**
- ❌ "Beach" (no motion described)
- ❌ "Person standing still" (minimal movement)
- ❌ "Multiple complex scenes" (too ambitious for 8 seconds)

### Key Elements for Video Prompts

**Motion & Action** - What's moving?
- Natural motion: "leaves rustling in wind," "water flowing"
- Object motion: "car driving," "bird flying," "person walking"
- Camera motion: "camera panning," "zooming in," "orbiting around"

**Environment** - Where is this happening?
- Set the scene: "in a bustling city," "on a quiet beach," "through a forest"
- Include atmosphere: "foggy morning," "golden hour," "stormy weather"

**Camera Work** - How is it filmed?
- "Slow motion," "time lapse," "steady cam," "drone footage"
- "Close-up," "wide shot," "tracking shot," "aerial view"
- "Handheld," "smooth pan," "dolly zoom"

**Style & Mood**
- "Cinematic," "documentary style," "dreamy," "dramatic"
- "Realistic," "artistic," "commercial quality"

### Video-Specific Tips

**Do's:**
- ✅ Describe movement clearly
- ✅ Keep it simple - one main action or scene
- ✅ Specify camera movement if important
- ✅ Use temporal terms (slow motion, time lapse)
- ✅ Focus on visually interesting subjects

**Don'ts:**
- ❌ Try to fit multiple scenes in 8 seconds
- ❌ Describe complex narratives
- ❌ Request rapid scene changes
- ❌ Include dialogue or specific audio
- ❌ Expect photorealistic human faces/actions (challenging for AI)

## Examples

<CodeGroup>

```python Python SDK
from incredible_python import Incredible
import base64

client = Incredible(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.generate_video(
    prompt="Ocean waves",
    size="1280x720"
)

print(f"Video ID: {response.video_id}")
print(f"Duration: {response.duration}s")

# Extract and save video
video_data = response.video_url.split(',')[1]
with open('generated_video.mp4', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(base64.b64decode(video_data))

print("Video saved!")
```

```ts TypeScript SDK
import { IncredibleClient } from '@incredible-ai/sdk';
import fs from 'fs';

const client = new IncredibleClient();

const response = await client.videos({
  prompt: 'A golden retriever playing in a sunny park',
  size: '1280x720'
});

if (response.success && response.video_url) {
  // Extract and save video
  const base64Data = response.video_url.split(',')[1];
  const videoBuffer = Buffer.from(base64Data, 'base64');
  fs.writeFileSync('generated_video.mp4', videoBuffer);
  console.log('Video saved!');
}
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/generate-video" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A golden retriever playing in a sunny park",
    "size": "1280x720"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Request Parameters

### prompt (required)
A detailed description of the video you want to generate, including motion, environment, and mood. Focus on describing dynamic elements and movement.

**Prompt length:** 1-1000 characters. Optimal: 30-150 characters with clear action description.

**See "Writing Effective Video Prompts" above for detailed guidance.**

### size (optional)
Video resolution and aspect ratio. Default: `1280x720` (720p landscape).

**Available resolutions:**

**1280x720 (720p Landscape)** - Default
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- Best for: YouTube, presentations, website embeds
- File size: Moderate
- Generation time: Standard

**720x1280 (720p Portrait)**
- Aspect ratio: 9:16
- Best for: Instagram/TikTok Stories, mobile-first content
- File size: Moderate
- Generation time: Standard

**1920x1080 (1080p Landscape / Full HD)**
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- Best for: High-quality YouTube, professional content
- File size: Larger
- Generation time: Longer

**1080x1920 (1080p Portrait)**

- Generation time: Standard

**Selection guide:**
- **Mobile/Social:** Use portrait (9:16) or square (1:1)
- **YouTube/Web:** Use landscape (16:9)
- **Quality vs Speed:** Lower resolutions generate faster
- **File size:** Higher resolutions = larger files

### input_reference (optional)
A base64-encoded reference image to animate into video. This enables image-to-video generation where you provide a starting frame and the AI adds motion.

**Use cases for image-to-video:**
- **Animate photos** - Bring static images to life
- **Product demonstrations** - Show products in motion
- **Brand consistency** - Start from your existing visual assets
- **Character animation** - Animate illustrations or artwork
- **Architectural visualization** - Add life to renderings

**How to use:**
```python
import base64

# Load your image
with open("reference.jpg", "rb") as f:
    image_data = f.read()

# Encode as base64
encoded_image = base64.b64encode(image_data).decode('utf-8')

# Generate video from image
response = client.generate_video(
    prompt="Camera slowly pans across the scene, gentle movement",
    input_reference=encoded_image,
    size="1280x720"
)
```

**Tips for image-to-video:**
- Start with high-quality, well-composed images
- Describe the motion/animation you want
- Keep motion expectations realistic (subtle movements work best)
- Avoid images with too much complexity

**Supported image formats:** JPEG, PNG, WebP (max 10MB)

## Best Practices

**Prompt Engineering for Videos:**
- Focus on a single, clear action or scene
- Describe motion explicitly ("waves crashing," "camera panning")
- Include camera movement for more dynamic results
- Use cinematic terms for professional looks
- Specify pace (slow motion, time lapse)

**Technical Considerations:**
- Lower resolutions generate faster and use less bandwidth
- Portrait formats are ideal for mobile platforms
- Landscape formats for traditional viewing
- Square for universal social media compatibility

**Performance:**
- Video generation takes 1-10 minutes - implement proper timeout handling
- Consider queueing or background processing for user-facing apps
- Cache frequently requested videos
- Provide loading indicators and progress updates to users

**Quality Optimization:**
- Use clear, simple prompts
- Avoid overly complex scenes
- Natural phenomena work well (water, fire, clouds)
- Camera movements are easier than complex object actions
- Test with various prompts to learn what works best

**Integration Patterns:**
- **Async processing** - Start generation, notify user when complete
- **Preview thumbnails** - Generate image first to preview before video
- **Batch generation** - Queue multiple videos for efficient processing
- **Fallback strategy** - Have backup content if generation fails

## Handling Video Output

Videos are returned as base64-encoded data URIs in the format:
```
data:video/mp4;base64,AAAIGZ0...
```

**Decoding and saving:**

```python
# Python
import base64

# Extract base64 data (remove data URI prefix)
video_data = response.video_url.split(',')[1]

# Decode and save
with open('video.mp4', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(base64.b64decode(video_data))
```

```typescript
// TypeScript/Node.js
import fs from 'fs';

// Extract base64 data
const base64Data = response.video_url.split(',')[1];

// Decode and save
const videoBuffer = Buffer.from(base64Data, 'base64');
fs.writeFileSync('video.mp4', videoBuffer);
```

```javascript
// Browser JavaScript
// Create download link
const link = document.createElement('a');
link.href = response.video_url;
link.download = 'generated_video.mp4';
link.click();
```

**Why base64?**
- Ensures reliable transmission over HTTP
- No need for separate file hosting
- Immediate availability
- Simplified API response structure

**File sizes:**
- 720p: ~1-3MB for 8 seconds
- 1080p: ~2-5MB for 8 seconds
- Depends on complexity and motion

## Important Notes

**Generation Time:**
Video generation is computationally intensive. Expect 1-10 minutes depending on:
- Resolution requested
- Scene complexity
- Current server load
- Whether using image-to-video

**Implement appropriate timeout handling** (suggest 15-minute timeout).

**Content Policy:**
Videos must comply with content policies. Inappropriate content will be rejected.

**Limitations:**
- Video length: Fixed at 8 seconds
- No audio generation (silent videos)
- Best results with natural phenomena and simple motions
- Complex human actions may not be photorealistic

**Rate Limits:**
Video generation has strict rate limits due to computational cost. Contact support for enterprise quotas.

## Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "video_id": "operation_abc123",
  "video_url": "data:video/mp4;base64,AAAIGZ0...",
  "status": "completed",
  "duration": 8
}
```

**Note:** Generation takes 1-10 minutes. Videos are 8 seconds long. The `video_url` is a base64 data URI—extract and decode to save as MP4 file.
