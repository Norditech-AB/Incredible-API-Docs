Agent MAX is the execution engine behind Incredible's agent capabilities. It's designed for **Deep Work**—complex, multi-step tasks that require accuracy, persistence, and autonomous error recovery.

This page provides technical details on each capability. For the user-facing overview, see [Agent MAX (Agents docs)](/agents/agent-max).

## Deep Work Features

Agent MAX includes 11 core capabilities that ensure agents complete tasks reliably:

## Anti-Hallucination

Agents map real data from context and validate every action before executing.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Input validation against available context; output verification before committing |
| **Result** | Near-zero hallucination on function calls |
| **Guarantee** | No fabricated data, no wrong parameters |

**Technical details:**
- All function call parameters are validated against schema definitions
- Outputs are traced to source data in connected apps
- Agents reject requests that require information not present in context

---

## Anti-Loop

Agents detect stuck states and repeated action patterns, terminating cleanly instead of running indefinitely.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Pattern detection for repeated actions; stuck-state recognition |
| **Result** | Clean termination when no progress is possible |
| **Guarantee** | No infinite loops, no runaway costs |

**Technical details:**
- Action history is analyzed for repetition patterns
- Stuck detection triggers after configurable thresholds
- Graceful shutdown preserves partial results where possible

---

## Laser Focus

Agents maintain goal alignment across long-context, multi-step workflows—even 20+ step tasks.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Goal anchoring; intermediate output filtering |
| **Result** | Consistent task completion without drift |
| **Guarantee** | No distraction from intermediate outputs |

**Technical details:**
- Primary goal is preserved and re-referenced throughout execution
- Intermediate results are evaluated for relevance before influencing next steps
- Long tasks are chunked with goal validation at each checkpoint

---

## Start to Finish

Agents execute end-to-end with built-in completeness checks. All steps are verified before marking done.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Step verification; completeness validation |
| **Result** | Full task execution with confirmation |
| **Guarantee** | No partial outputs, no silent failures |

**Technical details:**
- Each step produces verifiable outputs
- Final validation checks all expected deliverables
- Incomplete runs are flagged with specific failure points

---

## Precision Actions

Agents validate inputs and outputs on every function call with near-perfect parameter accuracy.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Schema validation; type checking; constraint enforcement |
| **Result** | Exact execution of requested actions |
| **Guarantee** | Agents do exactly what was asked |

**Technical details:**
- Function schemas define required and optional parameters
- Type coercion follows strict rules
- Out-of-bounds values trigger validation errors, not silent failures

---

## Deep Memory™

Agents compress context automatically—up to 90% more efficient. Smart caching keeps relevant information available across long tasks.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Context compression; relevance-weighted caching |
| **Result** | 10x more context capacity without forgetting |
| **Guarantee** | Large tasks and datasets stay in focus |

**Technical details:**
- Automatic summarization of older context
- Key facts are preserved at full fidelity
- Cache invalidation based on task relevance

---

## Safety Built In

Agents include guardrails out of the box: validation, error handling, stuck detection, and auto-termination.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Multi-layer validation; error boundaries; automatic shutdown |
| **Result** | Protected execution without additional configuration |
| **Guarantee** | No safety engineering required |

**Technical details:**
- Input sanitization on all external data
- Error boundaries prevent cascade failures
- Resource limits enforced at runtime
- Automatic termination on unsafe states

---

## Fast Retries

Agents cache context between actions. Retries rebuild from cache, not from scratch.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Context caching; incremental retry |
| **Result** | 80% lower retry costs |
| **Guarantee** | Mistakes don't compound |

**Technical details:**
- Successful action results are cached
- Failed actions retry with cached context
- Cache persistence configurable per task type

---

## Self-Heal

Agents validate inputs in real-time and adapt when something fails. Built-in feedback loops enable automatic adjustment and retry.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Real-time validation; adaptive retry; feedback loops |
| **Result** | Automatic error recovery |
| **Guarantee** | Errors get fixed without restarting the task |

**Technical details:**
- Failure patterns are analyzed for root cause
- Alternative approaches are attempted automatically
- Learning from failures improves subsequent attempts

---

## Adaptive Routing

Agents select the optimal model for each step. Lightweight models handle simple actions; powerful models handle complex reasoning.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Task complexity analysis; dynamic model selection |
| **Result** | Optimal cost/performance balance |
| **Guarantee** | Faster and cheaper, automatically |

**Technical details:**
- Step complexity is estimated before execution
- Model routing based on reasoning requirements
- Cost optimization without quality degradation

---

## Agentic Reasoning

Agents use chain-of-thought planning before execution, built on 30+ prompting frameworks from frontier AI research.

| Aspect | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| **Mechanism** | Chain-of-thought planning; multi-framework prompting |
| **Result** | Better sequencing and higher reliability |
| **Guarantee** | Agents think before they act |

**Technical details:**
- Planning phase generates execution strategy
- Multiple reasoning frameworks available
- Step sequencing optimized for task requirements

## Using Agent MAX via API

Agent MAX powers the `/agent` endpoint. All capabilities are enabled by default.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.incredible.one/v1/agent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task": "Research competitors and create a summary report",
    "integrations": ["web_search", "gmail"],
    "user_id": "user_123"
  }'
```

For full API documentation, see [Agent Endpoint](/api-reference/services/agent).

## When to Use Agent MAX

Agent MAX is designed for tasks that require:

- **Multi-step execution** — 5+ steps with dependencies
- **Long-running processes** — Tasks that take minutes, not seconds
- **High accuracy requirements** — Financial data, customer communications
- **Autonomous operation** — Scheduled or triggered runs without supervision
- **Error resilience** — Tasks that must complete despite API failures or edge cases

For simple, single-step operations, the standard [Answer](/api-reference/services/answer) or [Conversation](/api-reference/services/conversation) endpoints may be more appropriate.
