## Overview

Perform comprehensive, multi-step research that:

- **Plans research** — Determines what searches to run
- **Gathers information** — Performs multiple web searches
- **Synthesizes findings** — Combines information into a report
- **Provides citations** — Links back to original sources
- **Structured output** — Returns JSON matching your schema

## Output schemas

Define exactly how you want results formatted:

```json Company comparison
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "companies": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "name": {"type": "string"},
          "founded": {"type": "string"},
          "revenue": {"type": "number"},
          "employees": {"type": "integer"}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json Market analysis
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "market_size": {"type": "number"},
    "growth_rate": {"type": "number"},
    "key_players": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {"type": "string"}
    },
    "trends": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {"type": "string"}
    }
  }
}
```

```json Technical comparison
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "features": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "name": {"type": "string"},
          "supported_by": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {"type": "string"}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Metadata

Each response includes useful metadata:

- `research_id` — Unique identifier for this research task
- `status` — Completion status
- `searches_performed` — Number of searches executed
- `pages_read` — Number of web pages analyzed
- `citations` — Source URLs with titles

## Use cases

**Competitive Intelligence**
- Compare competitors' features and pricing
- Analyze market positioning
- Track product launches

**Market Research**
- Industry size and growth
- Key players and trends
- Customer sentiment

**Technical Research**
- Technology comparisons
- Best practices and patterns
- Implementation guides

**Due Diligence**
- Company backgrounds
- Financial information
- Leadership profiles

**Content Creation**
- Research for articles
- Data for presentations
- Fact-checking sources

## Caching

Enable caching to reuse results for identical requests:

```json
{
  "instructions": "...",
  "use_cache": true
}
```

Benefits:
- Faster responses
- Lower costs
- Consistent results

Cache duration: 24 hours

## Tips for best results

1. **Be specific**: Clear instructions get better results
2. **Use schemas**: Structured output ensures consistency
3. **Include context**: Mention time frames, regions, or specific aspects
4. **Request citations**: Ask for sources in your instructions

## Example instructions

**Good** ✅
> "Compare the flagship smartphones from Apple, Samsung, and Google released in 2024. Include model name, starting price, screen size, camera specs, and battery capacity. Provide citations for each specification."

**Too vague** ❌
> "Tell me about phones"

**Good** ✅
> "Research the current state of quantum computing. Focus on: 1) Leading companies and their qubit counts, 2) Recent breakthroughs in 2024, 3) Expected timeline for commercial applications. Return as structured data with citations."

**Too vague** ❌
> "What's happening with quantum computing?"
