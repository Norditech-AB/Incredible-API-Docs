## Overview

Deep Research is an advanced AI research assistant that conducts comprehensive, multi-step investigations on any topic. Unlike simple web search, Deep Research autonomously explores topics in depth, synthesizes information from multiple sources, and produces structured, citation-backed reports.

**What makes Deep Research powerful:**
- **Autonomous research** - Conducts multi-step investigations without human intervention
- **Source synthesis** - Combines information from multiple sources into coherent insights
- **Structured output** - Returns organized, formatted research reports
- **Citation tracking** - Maintains source attribution throughout the research process
- **Depth control** - Adjust research thoroughness based on your needs

**Real-world applications:**
- **Market research** - Analyze industries, competitors, and trends
- **Academic research** - Literature reviews and topic exploration
- **Due diligence** - Company research and background checks
- **Content creation** - Research for articles, reports, and presentations
- **Decision support** - Gather comprehensive information for strategic decisions
- **Competitive analysis** - Deep dives into competitors and market position

Deep Research is like having a research assistant that can read hundreds of sources, identify key insights, and compile professional reports in minutes instead of hours.

## How Deep Research Works

Deep Research uses an agentic workflow to conduct thorough investigations:

### Research Process

1. **Query Understanding** - Analyzes your research instructions to identify key topics and questions
2. **Research Planning** - Creates a research strategy and identifies information needs
3. **Multi-Step Search** - Performs multiple targeted searches to gather comprehensive information
4. **Source Evaluation** - Assesses source credibility and relevance
5. **Information Synthesis** - Combines insights from multiple sources into coherent findings
6. **Report Generation** - Produces structured output with citations
7. **Quality Check** - Verifies completeness and accuracy

### Research Depths

**Quick (5-10 minutes)**
- 10-15 sources consulted
- High-level overview
- Key facts and basic insights
- Best for: Quick briefings, initial exploration

**Standard (10-20 minutes)**
- 20-30 sources consulted
- Balanced depth and breadth
- Comprehensive key findings
- Best for: Most research tasks, reports, decision support

**Thorough (20-40 minutes)**
- 40+ sources consulted
- In-depth analysis
- Detailed insights and connections
- Best for: Academic research, strategic planning, comprehensive reports

The research process is asynchronous - the API will work through multiple search iterations, analyze sources, and compile findings before returning the complete report.

## Examples

<CodeGroup>

```python Python SDK
from incredible_python import Incredible

client = Incredible(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.deep_research(
    instructions="Research the history of Python programming language"
)

print(response.output)

if response.citations:
    print(f"\nCitations: {len(response.citations)}")
    for citation in response.citations:
        print(f"  - {citation.title}: {citation.url}")
```

```ts TypeScript SDK
import { IncredibleClient } from '@incredible-ai/sdk';

const client = new IncredibleClient();

const response = await client.research.deepResearch({
  instructions: 'Comprehensive analysis of renewable energy trends in 2024'
});

if (response.success) {
  console.log('Research completed!');
  console.log('Report:', response.report || response.content);
  console.log('Citations:', response.citations?.length || 0);
}
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.incredible.one/v1/deep-research" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Comprehensive analysis of renewable energy trends in 2024",
    "depth": "standard"
  }'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Request Parameters

### instructions (required)
Your research task described in natural language. Be as specific as possible about what you want to learn, what format you prefer, and any particular angles or perspectives to explore.

**Effective research instructions:**

**Good examples:**
- ✅ "Research the current state of quantum computing, focusing on commercial applications and major players. Include market size estimates and recent breakthroughs."
- ✅ "Analyze the impact of remote work on tech company productivity between 2020-2024. Compare different company approaches and outcomes."
- ✅ "Investigate the environmental impact of electric vehicles, considering battery production, charging infrastructure, and lifecycle emissions. Compare with traditional vehicles."

**Less effective:**
- ❌ "Tell me about AI" (too broad, no specific angle)
- ❌ "What is blockchain?" (too simple, better suited for Answer API)
- ❌ "Research everything about climate change" (too vast, needs focus)

**Tips for better results:**
- **Be specific** - Define scope, time period, geographic region
- **State your goal** - "for a presentation," "to make a decision," "for an article"
- **Specify format** - "executive summary," "pros and cons list," "timeline"
- **Include constraints** - "focusing on US market," "from 2020-2024," "excluding speculative sources"

### depth (optional)
Controls how thorough the research should be. Options: `"quick"`, `"standard"` (default), `"thorough"`.

**Quick Research (5-10 minutes)**
- Fast turnaround for basic questions
- 10-15 sources
- High-level overview and key facts
- Best for: Briefings, quick fact-checking, initial exploration

**Standard Research (10-20 minutes)**
- Balanced approach for most use cases
- 20-30 sources
- Comprehensive coverage of main topics
- Best for: Business reports, decision support, content research

**Thorough Research (20-40 minutes)**
- Deep investigation with extensive source analysis
- 40+ sources
- Detailed insights, connections, and nuances
- Best for: Academic research, strategic planning, comprehensive analysis

**Cost vs Quality tradeoff:**
- Quick = Lower cost, faster results, less comprehensive
- Thorough = Higher cost, slower results, more comprehensive
- Standard = Balanced for most needs

### max_sources (optional)
Maximum number of sources to consult during research. Range: 5-100.

This parameter allows fine-grained control over research scope:
- `5-10` - Quick fact checks
- `20-30` - Standard research (recommended)
- `50-100` - Exhaustive analysis

**Note:** More sources = longer research time and higher cost. The AI will prioritize quality over quantity, so it may use fewer sources than the maximum if sufficient information is found.

### response_format (optional)
A JSON schema defining the structure of the research output. When provided, Deep Research will format findings according to your schema.

**Common structured formats:**

**Executive Summary:**
```python
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "executive_summary": {"type": "string"},
    "key_findings": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
    "recommendations": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
    "risks": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
  }
}
```

**Competitive Analysis:**
```python
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "companies": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "name": {"type": "string"},
          "strengths": {"type": "array"},
          "weaknesses": {"type": "array"},
          "market_share": {"type": "string"}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Timeline:**
```python
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "events": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "date": {"type": "string"},
          "event": {"type": "string"},
          "impact": {"type": "string"}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Structured output is powerful for:
- Feeding research directly into applications
- Creating consistent report formats
- Building dashboards and visualizations
- Automating workflows based on research findings

## Best Practices

**Research Design:**
- **Start with a clear question** - Well-defined research goals produce better results
- **Scope appropriately** - Narrow topics get better depth, broad topics need "standard" or "thorough"
- **Specify time periods** - "in 2024," "since 2020," "historical perspective"
- **Define success criteria** - What information would make this research complete?

**Depth Selection:**
- Use **quick** for time-sensitive decisions or initial exploration
- Use **standard** as the default for most business and content needs
- Use **thorough** for high-stakes decisions or academic research
- Consider cost and time constraints when choosing depth

**Structured Output:**
- Design schemas that match your application's needs
- Include optional fields for flexibility
- Use enums for constrained values
- Test schemas with sample research first

**Quality Control:**
- Review citations to verify source quality
- Cross-check key facts if stakes are high
- Consider running multiple research sessions with different angles
- Combine Deep Research with human expertise for critical decisions

**Performance Optimization:**
- Cache research results for repeated queries
- Use appropriate depth levels to balance cost and quality
- Consider batching related research queries
- Monitor API usage to optimize costs

**Integration Patterns:**
- **Automated reporting** - Schedule regular research on tracked topics
- **Decision support** - Research before major business decisions
- **Content pipeline** - Research for article/content creation
- **Competitive intelligence** - Regular deep dives on competitors
- **Market monitoring** - Track industry trends and developments
