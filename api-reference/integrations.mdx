# Integrations API

The Integrations API allows you to connect to and interact with various third-party services like Gmail, Perplexity, and more. This API provides endpoints for listing available integrations, establishing connections, and executing features through those integrations.

## Overview

The Integrations API supports two main authentication methods:
- **API Key**: For services that use simple API key authentication
- **OAuth**: For services that require OAuth 1.0 or OAuth 2.0 authentication

## Base URL

```
https://api.incredible.com/v1/integrations
```

## Authentication

All endpoints require proper user identification via the `user_id` parameter in request bodies.

## Available Integrations

Currently supported integrations include:

- **Gmail**: Send and manage emails
- **Perplexity**: AI-powered search and research
- More integrations coming soon...

## Quick Start

1. **List available integrations**:
   ```bash
   GET /v1/integrations
   ```

2. **Connect to an integration**:
   ```bash
   POST /v1/integrations/{integration_id}/connect
   ```

3. **Execute a feature**:
   ```bash
   POST /v1/integrations/{integration_id}/execute
   ```

## Error Handling

All endpoints return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in JSON format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error description",
  "details": "Additional error details",
  "instructions": "How to resolve the error"
}
```

Common status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad request (missing parameters, invalid input)
- `404`: Integration or feature not found
- `500`: Internal server error
