# Fire and Forget AI Agents

**Agent MAX** is not another chatbot. It's an **execution engine** for Deep Work—complex tasks that take minutes (not seconds), require perfect accuracy, and must succeed without human intervention.

## The Problem with AI Agents Today

Most AI agents fail at real work. They:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="❌ Hallucinate" icon="ghost">
    Make up data, call wrong functions, invent parameters
  </Card>
  <Card title="❌ Get Stuck" icon="circle-pause">
    Loop forever, burn credits, never finish
  </Card>
  <Card title="❌ Lose Focus" icon="eyes">
    Drift off-task during multi-step workflows
  </Card>
  <Card title="❌ Crash Silently" icon="skull">
    Die mid-task with no way to recover
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Agent MAX was built to solve all of this.**

## What Makes Agent MAX Different

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="🧠 Live-Code Execution">
    **This is the superpower.**
    
    Traditional agents play telephone:
    ```
    Agent → Tool Call → Wait → Result → Agent → Tool Call → Wait...
    ```
    
    Agent MAX writes and executes code:
    ```python
    # Agent MAX writes this, runs it, gets results
    customers_at_risk = [c for c in customers if c.churn_score > 0.7]
    emails = [draft_email(c) for c in customers_at_risk[:10]]
    send_batch(emails)
    # Only the final result goes back to the model
    ```
    
    **Result:** 30-40% fewer tokens. 10x faster. Parallel tool calls.

## Structured Output (Guaranteed)

Need JSON that matches a schema? Use `run_with_results()`. **Guaranteed.**

```python
# Open the file properly
with open("meeting.mp3", "rb") as audio_file:
    result = agent.run_with_results(
        goal="Extract all action items from this meeting transcript",
        files=[audio_file],
        result_structure={
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "action_items": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "items": {
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "task": {"type": "string"},
                            "assignee": {"type": "string"},
                            "deadline": {"type": "string"}
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
